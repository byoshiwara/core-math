<introduction><p>Now that you a good intuitive grasp of addition, we'll turn our attention to subtraction. It will help if you keep two facts in mind: <ul>
  <li><p>subtraction is the opposite operation for addition, and</p></li>
  <li><p>there are only two directions to move on the number line, right or left!</p></li>
</ul></p>

<p>So, consider: <ul>
  <li><p>To add a positive number, we move to the right on the number line.</p></li>
  <li><p>To subtract a positive number, we move to the left on the number line.</p></li>
  <li><p>To add a negative number, we move to the left on the number line.</p></li>
  <li><p>To subtract a negative number, we move to the ????? on the number line.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<p>Let's look at some examples.</p></introduction>

<subsection><title>Subtracting a Positive Number</title>

<p>Compare the two number lines shown below. The first number line illustrates the addition problem
    <me>(+8) + (-3)</me>
The second number line illustrates the subtraction problem
    <me>(+8) - (+3)</me></p>

<image source="subtpos.png"></image>

<p>Both number lines look the same, and both problems have the same answer, +5. On each number line, we start at +8 and move 3 units to the left.  This example illustrates an important fact.</p>

<assemblage><title>Sutracting a Positive Number</title>
<p>Subtracting a positive number is the same as adding the corresponding negative number. For both operations, we move to the left on the number line.</p></assemblage>

<p>Of course, we don't need a number line to calculate simple subtractions like <m>8-3</m>.  But number lines may help us with less familiar problems.</p>

<assemblage><title>Definition</title>
<p>Recall that the answer to an addition problem is called the <term>sum</term>, and the answer to a subtraction problem is called the <term>difference</term>.</p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Use number lines to illustrate the sum or difference.<ol marker="a" cols="2">

<p>Both problems have the same answer, <m>-8</m>.</p></solution></example>

</ol></p></answer></exercise>

<p>Looking back at these examples, we see that we can rewrite a subtraction problem as an equivalent addition problem, then use the rules for addition.</p>

<example><statement><p>Rewrite each subtraction problem as an equivalent addition problem, and compute.
<ol marker="a" cols="2">
  <li><m>6 - (+10)</m></li>
  <li><m>-4 - (+3)</m></li>
</ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol marker="a">
<li><p>Subtracting 10 gives the same result as adding <m>-10</m>, so we can write
    <me> 6 - (+10) = 6 +(-10)</me>
  To add two numbers with opposite signs we subtract their unsigned parts to get  <m>10 - 6 = 4</m>.  And because 10 is greater than 6, the answer is negative. Thus
      <me>6 - (+10) = 6 +(-10) = -4</me></p></li>
<li><p>Subtracting 3 gives the same result as adding <m>-3</m>, so we can write
    <me> -4 - (+3) = -4 +(-3)</me>
  To add two numbers with the same sign we add their unsigned parts to get <m>4 + 3 = 7</m>.  And because both numbers are negative, the answer is negative. Thus
      <me>-4 - (+3) = -4 +(-3) = -7</me></p></li>
</ol></p></solution></example>

<p>If you feel confident with adding signed numbers, with a little practice you'll be able to do these subtraction problems in your head. Until then, don't hesitate to write down the calculation.</p>

<subsection><title>Subtracting a Negative Number</title>

<p>What does it mean to subtract a negative number?  Consider the problem
    <me>2 - (-5)</me>
If we use a number line to help us, we begin by plotting the first number, 2. We should then move five units away, but in which direction? Recall that when we add <m>-5</m>, we move to the left.</p>

<p> But there are only two directions on the number line, so when we subtract <m>-5</m>, we must move to the right. We finish the problem as shown below, to obtain an answer of <m>+7</m>.</p>
    <image source="subtneg.png" width="60%"></image>

<p>Subtracting <m>-5</m> on the number line looks the same as adding <m>+5</m>. In both problems we move 5 units to the right, and in both problems the answer is 7.
    <me> 2 - (-5) = 7 ~~~~ \text{and} ~~~~2 + (+5) = 7 </me></p>

<assemblage><title>Subtracting a Negative Number</title>
  <p>Subtracting a negative number gives the same result as adding a positive number. For both operations, we move to the right on the number line.</p></assemblage>

<note><p>This fact makes sense if we think in terms of money, with negative numbers representing debts.  Suppose you have a net worth of $200, after writing a check for $500 to repay a loan from your father. Then your father calls to say “As your graduation present, I've decided to cancel your $500 debt, so keep the money.” You now have $700. Subtracting a 
debt of $500 has the same effect as adding $500 to your account!</p></note>

<p>Putting together all our examples so far, we can see that:</p>

<assemblage><title>Subtracting Signed Numbers</title>
  <p>Every subtraction problem can be written as an equivalent addition problem.</p></assemblage>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Rule for Subtraction</title>

<p>We don't really have a new rule for subtraction. Instead, we change every subtraction problem to an equivalent addition problem, and then follow the <xref ref="addrules" text="custom>">Rules for Addition</xref>.</p>

<assemblage><title>Subtraction Rule for Signed Numbers</title>
<p><ol>
  <li><p>To subtract a positive number, add the corresponding negative number.</p></li>
  <li><p>To subtract a negative number, add the corresponding positive number.</p></li>
</ol></p></assemblage>

<p>So how do we change a subtraction problem into an addition problem? Here is a three-step process to follow if the problem is too complicated for an intuitive approach.</p>

<assemblage><title>To rewrite a subtraction problem as an equivalent addition problem:</title>
<p><ol>
  <li><p>Leave the first number alone.</p></li>
  <li><p>Change the sign of the second number.</p></li>
  <li><p>Change the subtraction symbol to an addition symbol.</p></li>
</ol></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Rewrite each subtraction problem as an equivalent addition problem, then compute.<ol marker="a" cols="2">
  <li><p><m>-4 - (+3)</m></p></li>
  <li><p><m>-8 - (-12)</m></p></li>
</ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol marker="a">
  <li><p>Subtracting positive 3 is the same as adding negative 3, and we rewrite the difference as a sum as follows.</p>
          <image source="difftosuma.png" width="60%"></image>
      <p>Now we can use the Rules for Addition. To add two numbers with the same sign we add their unsigned parts to get  <m>4 + 3 = 7</m>.  And because both numbers are negative, the answer is negative.  Thus
          <me>-4 - (+3) = -4 + (-3) = -7</me></p></li>
  <li><p>Subtracting -12  is the same as adding 12, so</p>
            <image source="difftosumb.png" width="60%"></image>
      <p>Now we use the Rules for Addition:  Because <m>-8</m>  and <m>+12</m>  have opposite signs, we subtract their unsigned parts to get  <m>12 - 8 = 4</m>.  And because 12 is larger than 8, the answer is positive. Thus,
            <me>-8 - (-12) = -8 + (+12) = 4</me></p></li>
</ol></p></solution></example>

<subsection xml:id="notation"><title>Notation</title>

<p>We have now used the symbol "<m>-</m>"  in two different ways:  to indicate subtraction and to denote a negative number. We will have to be careful not to confuse these two different meanings. So far, we have been careful to include the sign of a number inside parentheses, to distinguish it from the operation symbol for adding or subtracting. But you won't always be provided with these helpful hints. Consider the expression
    <me>-8 - 13</me></p>

<p>We can read this expression as "negative 8 subtract 13." Or, changing to an equivalent addition problem, we get
    <me>-8 + (-13)</me></p>

<p>You can check that both these expressions yield the same result, <m>-21</m>. After all, we perform subtraction by changing to an equivalent addition problem. So why not interpret <m>~-8 - 13~</m> as a sum in the first place?</p>

<p>That is what we'll do. When we see a string of numbers separated by plus or minus signs, we'll treat it as a sum of signed numbers.  For example, the expression
      <me> 4 - 9 + 6 - 2</me>
means "add <m>4</m> and <m>-9</m> and <m>6</m> and <m>-2</m>," to get <m>-1</m>.</p>

<example><statement><p>Simplify the sum of signed numbers  <m>-3 - 6 + 4</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>Working from left to right, first we add <m>-3</m> and <m>-6</m> to get <m>-9</m>, then we add <m>+4</m> to the <m>-9</m>, to get <m>-5</m>.</p></solution></example>

<activity><title>Profit and Loss</title>

<p>Here is a formula for calculating profit.
    <me>\blert{\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost}}</me>

Revenue is the amount of money a company takes in from selling its product. They have to subtract their operating costs from their revenue to calculate their profit. If a company's costs exceed its revenues, their profit will be negative, which means that the company will experience a loss.</p>
