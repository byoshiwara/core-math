<exercisegroup><introduction><p>Use the number grid below to continue the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and find all the primes between 100 and 200. Begin by crossing out all multiples of 2, then all multiples of 3, etc. If possible, use a different color for the multiples of each prime. Then answer the questions in Problems 23-30.</p>
