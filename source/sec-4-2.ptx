<subsection><title>Take Part</title>

<p>What does it mean to take <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of something? It means to divide the quantity by 3. For instance, to take <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of 12 eggs, we divide 12 by 3 and take 4 eggs.</p>

    <image source="foureggs.png" width="80%"></image>

<p>The same is true if we take <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of a fraction.  For example, to take <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of half a pie, we divide the half pie into 3 pieces.</p>

    <image source="sixthpie.png" width="70%"></image>

<note><p>When we divide a fraction into more pieces, we increase its denominator. Taking <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of half a pie increased the number of pieces by a factor of 3, so the denominator increased from 2 to 6.  We could say that dividing a fraction by 3 multiplies the denominator by 3.</p></note>

<p>These examples suggest that to take <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of a fraction we can multiply the fraction by <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m>, like this:
    <me>\dfrac{1}{3} \times \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{1 \times 1}{3 \times 2} = \dfrac{1}{6}~~~~~~\blert{\dfrac{\text{Multiply the numerators together.}}{\text{Multiply the denominators together.}}}</me></p>

</ol></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Multiplying by <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> also works to find <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of a dozen eggs, if we write 12 as a fraction, <m>\dfrac{12}{1}</m>.
    <me>\dfrac{1}{3} \times \dfrac{12}{1} = \dfrac{1 \times 12}{3 \times 1} = \dfrac{12}{3} =4 ~~~~~~\blert{\dfrac{\text{Multiply the numerators together.}}{\text{Multiply the denominators together.}}}</me></p>

<p>In other words, to take <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of something, we can <m>\blert{\text{multiply}}</m> by <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m>.</p>

<p>Of course, the same idea works if we want to take <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m> of something, or <m>\dfrac{1}{5}</m> of something, or <m>\cdots</m> .</p>

<subsection><title>Multiplying by a Fraction</title>
  
<p>What does it mean to take <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> of something? It means to divide the quantity into 3 equal parts, and then take 2 of them. For instance, to take <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> of 12 eggs, we divide 12 into 3 groups of 4eggs each, and take 2 of those groups of 4 eggs, to get 8 eggs.</p> 

  <image source="eighteggs.png" width="70%"></image>

<p>Mathematically, we divide 12 by 3 and then multiply the result by 2. Earlier we saw that dividing by 3, or taking <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of something, is the same as multiplying by <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m>. Is taking <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> of something the same as multiplying by <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> ?  Yes!  Observe:

<me>\dfrac{2}{3}~ \text{of} ~12 = \dfrac{2}{3} \times \dfrac{12}{1} = \dfrac{2 \times 12}{3 \times 1} = \dfrac{24}{3} = 8</me></p>

<note><p>You might notice that when we multiplied 12 by <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m>, we actually multiplied by 2 first and then divided by 3, instead of the other way around, but the answer comes out the same.</p></note> 

<p>We can also multiply by <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> to take <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> of a fraction.</p>

<example><statement><sidebyside widths="70% 20%"><p>There was <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> of a pizza left in the refrigerator last night, but somebody ate <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> of it. How much of a whole pizza did they eat?</p>
  <image source="nightpizza.png"></image></sidebyside></statement>

<solution><p>We want to find <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> of <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m>, so we multiply the fractions together.
  <me>\dfrac{2}{3} \times \dfrac{3}{4} = \dfrac{2 \times 3}{3 \times 4} = \dfrac{6}{12} = \dfrac{1}{2}</me></p>

<p>Whoever ate the pizza ate <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> of a whole pizza. In the picture, you can see that <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> of a pizza has 3 equal parts, each of which is <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m> of a pizza. So 2 of those equal parts are <m>\dfrac{2}{4}</m>, or <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m>, of a whole pizza.</p></solution></example>

<p>Here is another way to visualize <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> of <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m>. First, draw a rectangle with 4 vertical slices and color 3 of them red to illustrate <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m>, like this:</p>  

  <image source="pinkcols.png" width="80%"></image> 

<p>Then, use horizontal lines to divide the rectangle into thirds, and color 2 of them blue to show <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> of the rectangle:</p>     

  <image source="pinkandblue.png" width="80%"></image>

<p>The pieces colored both pink and blue illustrate <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> of <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m>.  Notice that they make up <m>\dfrac{6}{12}</m> or <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> of the entire rectangle.</p>

<p>Here is another example using multiplication.</p>

<example><statement><p><ol marker="a">
  <li><p>Ronen has <m>1\dfrac{1}{2}</m> pounds of salmon to feed four people. How much salmon will be in each portion?</p></li>
  <li><p>A standard portion is 6 ounces. Will Ronen's salmon provide each person a standard portion?</p></li>
</ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol marker="a">
  <li><p>First, let's write <m>1\dfrac{1}{2}</m> pounds as a fraction:
    <me>1\dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{2}{2} + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{3}{2}</me>
  Because we are dividing <m>\dfrac{3}{2}</m> pounds among 4 people, each person gets <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m> of that amount. So we multiply <m>\dfrac{3}{2}</m> by <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m>.
    <me>\dfrac{3}{2} \times \dfrac{1}{4} = \dfrac{3 \times 1}{2 \times 4} = \dfrac{3}{8} ~~~~~~\blert{\dfrac{\text{Multiply numerators together.}}{\text{Multiply denominators together.}}}</me>
  Each person gets <m>\dfrac{3}{8}</m> of a pound of salmon.</p></li>
  <li><p>We'd like to know how many ounces are in <m>\dfrac{3}{8}</m> of a pound. A pound is equal to 16 ounces, so we multiply 16 by <m>\dfrac{3}{8}</m>.
    <me>\dfrac{3}{8} \times \dfrac{16}{1} = \dfrac{3 \times 16}{8 \times 1} = \dfrac{48}{8} = 6</me>
  Each person gets 6 ounces of salmon, which is a standard portion.</p></li>

<subsection><title>Dividing by a Fraction</title>

<p>When we divide a number, we are separating it into groups. For example, <m>12 \div 4</m> means to find how many groups of 4 fit into 12. The answer, of course, is 3; there are 3 groups of 4 in 12.</p>

    <image source="groups.png" width="60%"></image>

<p>But how about dividing by a fraction? What does it mean to divide a number by <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m>? (Notice that this is NOT the same as dividing by 3!) For example, <m>2 \div \dfrac{1}{3}</m>  means to find the number of thirds in 2 wholes.</p>

    <image source="sixthirds.png" width="50%"></image>

<p>There are 3 thirds in one whole, so in 2 wholes there must be <m>2 \times 3 = 6</m> thirds. We see that

    <me>2 \div \dfrac{1}{3} = 2 \times 3 = 6</me></p>

<note><p>Do you see that dividing by <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> is the same as multiplying by 3? Do you see why?</p></note>

<example><statement><p>Compute <m>3\dfrac{1}{2} \div \dfrac{1}{8}</m>,  and explain what it means.</p></statement>

<solution><p>The division asks how many eighths there are in <m>3\dfrac{1}{2}</m> wholes.</p>

    <image source="diveighths.png" width="80%"></image>

<p>Because there are 8 eighths in one whole, there must be  <m>3\dfrac{1}{2} \times 8</m> eighths in <m>3\dfrac{1}{2}</m> wholes. So

    <me>3\dfrac{1}{2} \div \dfrac{1}{8} = 3\dfrac{1}{2} \times 8 = \dfrac{7}{2} \times \dfrac{8}{1} = \dfrac{56}{2} = 28</me></p>

<p>There are 28 eighths in <m>3\dfrac{1}{2}</m> wholes.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>More Dividing by Fractions</title>

<p>We now know what it means to divide a number by <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m>,  and it turns out that dividing by <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> is the same as multiplying by 3. What does it mean to divide a number by <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m>?  Let's consider <m>4 \div \dfrac{2}{3}</m>. This division asks us how many groups of <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> can be made out of 4 wholes.</p>

    <image source="divtwothirds.png" width="80%"></image>

<p>In the picture, we see that there are 6 groups of <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> in 4 wholes. This tells us that
    <me>4 \div \dfrac{2}{3} = 6</me></p>

<p>But how can we calculate this result without the picture? Think about how we made the picture:</p>

  <assemblage><p><ul>
    <li><p>First, we separated each whole into thirds. This <em>multiplied</em> 4 wholes by 3, to get 12 pieces.</p></li>
    <li><p>Then we grouped the 12 pieces into groups of 2 thirds each. This <em>divided</em> the 12 pieces by 2, to get 6 groups.</p></li>
    <li><p>We started with 4, multiplied by 3, then divided by 2.</p></li>
  </ul></p>

<p>It seems that
        <me>4 \div \dfrac{2}{3}~~~~~~ \text{is the same as} ~~~~~~  4 \times \dfrac{3}{2}</me></p></assemblage>

<p>Let's check:
        <me>4 \times \dfrac{3}{2} = \dfrac{4}{1} \times \dfrac{3}{2} = \dfrac{4 \times 3}{1 \times 2} = \dfrac{12}{2} = 6</me></p>

<p>We have discovered a rule for division by a fraction.</p>

<assemblage><title>To divide a number by a fraction</title>
   <p>Multiply the number by the <term>reciprocal</term> of the fraction.</p></assemblage>

<note><p>Do you remember how to find the <term>reciprocal</term> of a fraction? We interchange the numerator and denominator. For example, the reciprocal of <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m>  is <m>\dfrac{4}{3}</m>,  and the reciprocal of 2, or <m>\dfrac{2}{1}</m>,  is <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m>.</p></note>

<example><statement><p>Compute <m>3\dfrac{3}{4} \div \dfrac{3}{8}</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>First we'll write <m>3\dfrac{3}{4}</m> as an improper fraction. Remember that <m>3\dfrac{3}{4}</m> means <m>\dfrac{3}{1} + \dfrac{3}{4}</m>.
  <me>\dfrac{3}{1} + \dfrac{3}{4} = \left(\dfrac{3}{1} \times \dfrac{\alert{4}}{\alert{4}} \right) + \dfrac{3}{4} = \dfrac{12}{4} + \dfrac{3}{4} = \dfrac{15}{4} ~~~~~~ \blert{\text{Build, then add.}}</me></p>

<p>To divide <m>\dfrac{15}{4}</m> by <m>\dfrac{3}{8}</m>, we multiply <m>\dfrac{15}{4}</m> by <m>\dfrac{8}{3}</m>.
    <md><mrow>\dfrac{15}{4} \div \dfrac{3}{8} \amp = \dfrac{15}{4} \times \dfrac{8}{3} = \dfrac{15 \times 8}{4 \times 3} ~~~~~~ \blert{\dfrac{\text{Multiply numerators together.}}{\text{Multiply denominators together.}}}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \dfrac{120}{12} = 10</mrow></md></p>

<p>So <m>3\dfrac{3}{4}</m> can be broken into 10 pieces of size <m>\dfrac{3}{8}</m>.</p>

    <image source="allotment2.png" width="60%"></image>
</activity>

<p>Here is one more example. It uses several of the skills we've learned.</p>

<example><statement><p>Carrie has <m>2\dfrac{1}{2}</m> yards of florist's ribbon, and each bouquet uses <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> of a yard. How many bouquets can she make?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We want to know how many pieces of length <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> of a yard can be cut from <m>2\dfrac{1}{2}</m> yards, so we will divide <m>2\dfrac{1}{2}</m> by <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m>.  First, we'll write <m>2\dfrac{1}{2}</m> as a fraction.

  <me>\dfrac{2}{1} + \dfrac{1}{2} = \left(\dfrac{2}{1} \times \dfrac{\alert{2}}{\alert{2}} \right) + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{4}{2} + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{5}{2} ~~~~~~ \blert{\text{Build, then add.}}</me></p>

<p>Next, we'll divide by <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m>.

  <md><mrow>\dfrac{5}{2} \alert{\div \dfrac{3}{4}} \amp = \dfrac{5}{2} \alert{\times \dfrac{4}{3}} ~~~~~~ \blert{\text{Multiply by the reciprocal.}}</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = \dfrac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 3} = \dfrac{20}{6} = \dfrac{10}{3} ~~~~~~ \blert{\dfrac{\text{Multiply numerators.}}{\text{Multiply denominators.}}}</mrow></md></p>

<p>Finally, <m>\dfrac{10}{3}</m> is equal to <m>3\dfrac{1}{3}</m>, so Carrie can make <m>3\dfrac{1}{3}</m> bouquets. Well, actually, she can make 3 bouquets, and has left <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of the amount for another bouquet. That is <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> of a yard, or
  <me>\dfrac{1}{3} \times \dfrac{3}{4} = \dfrac{3}{12} = \dfrac{1}{4}</me></p>

<p>After making 3 bouquets, she has <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m> yard left over.</p></solution></example>

<note><p>Look carefully at the last part of Example 6.  Remember that the division asks how many pieces of <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> yard can be cut from <m>2\dfrac{1}{2}</m> yards.  We got 3 whole pieces and <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of another piece: not <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of a yard, but <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of a piece!  Here is a picture:</p>
    <image source="thirdofgroup.png" width="70%"></image>
