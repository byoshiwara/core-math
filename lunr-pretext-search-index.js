  "body": " This book is meant for anyone who wants to refresh his or her basic math skills. Or for anyone who would like to increase their understanding of the principles behind those skills and why they work. The book can be used as a textbook for college students or other adults, or it can be used for individual study. The sections are largely independent, so a reader can pick and choose topics of interest.  The exposition proceeds at a leisurely pace so that the reader can feel comfortable with the material. In fact, you may find that some parts seem very elementary. That is fine; you can relax and congratulate yourself on your existing knowledge. Learning proceeds best when we examine a topic from various angles, and ideas are sealed in memory by revisiting them in different settings. We think you will find something new to think about in most sections.  Each Example in the text is followed by a similar Checkpoint for you to try yourself. There are also Activities that can be used in a classroom setting. If you are reading the book on your own, we hope you will try at least some of the Practice problems; keep pencil and paper handy to jot down your thoughts and calculations. Once again, learning occurs most efficiently, especially in mathematics, if you engage actively with the material.  But most of all, we hope you will find the material useful, and enjoy learning more about mathematics.  "

  "body": " Halves and Quarters   One-Half  Other Ways to Write One-Half  Fourths  Other Ways to Write Fourths  Fractions on a Number Line  Benchmark Fractions    One-Half  The most familiar fraction is , or   To find one-half of something, we divide it into pieces and take of them.  If we have a group of objects, we separate them into groups and take group. Each group is a part of the whole. We write this as a fraction like this:   of a dozen eggs (12 eggs) 6 eggs  eggs    of an hour (60 minutes) 30 minutes  clocks      Other Ways to Write One-Half  From the Example above, we see that and are different ways to write . Here are some more ways: eggs    Write fractions that are equal to .  Did you notice: To find the \"part\" of each fraction, we the \"whole\" by .  8, 12, 18, 50, 36, 100, divide, 2  Now that you know some different ways to represent , we can compare other fractions to .  One-Half  Write a fraction for each story, then decide whether the fraction is:  equal to one-half,  less than one-half, or  more than one-half.   Greta used a yardstick to measure a picture frame that is 20 inches wide. What fraction of a yard is that? (A yard is 36 inches.)    Whole  Part  Fraction Described in the Story  Fraction for One-Half        The fraction described in the story is one-half.  Josh is taking an 18-day course of antibiotics. What fraction of a month (30 days) is that?    Whole  Part  Fraction Described in the Story  Fraction for One-Half        The fraction described in the story is one-half.  Carol swam 660 yards today. What fraction of a mile is that? (A mile is 1760 yards.)    Whole  Part  Fraction Described in the Story  Fraction for One-Half        The fraction described in the story is one-half.  Noah's paycheck was $256. He deposited $128 in his savings account. What fraction of his paycheck was that?    Whole  Part  Fraction Described in the Story  Fraction for One-Half        The fraction described in the story is one-half.    Fourths  If we divide one whole into four parts, each part is of the whole.  If you take one-half of half a pizza, what fraction of the pizza do you have?  You have one-fourth of the pizza, or , because your piece is of equal pieces that make up the whole pizza. Because there are fourths in a whole pizza, after you take your piece, there are fourths, or of a pizza left.   Explain how you know that one-fourth of the grid is shaded.  How many squares are in the whole grid?  How many squares are in one-fourth of the grid?  How many squares are in three-fourths of the grid?  Half of half is shaded.  64, 16, 48   One-fourth is also called . (How many quarters are there in one dollar?)  Fourths  Show your work for each calculation.  Find one-fourth of the amount by taking one-half of one-half.  Find three-fourths of the amount by subtracting one-fourth from the whole.  Find three-fourths of the amount by multiplying one-fourth by three. Are your answers to parts (b) and (c) the same?    Norman's monthly salary is $3600. He deposits one-fourth of his salary in his savings account, and the rest in his checking account.      Jaycee owns a ranch of 3000 acres. She plans to grow corn on one-fourth of her land and raise cattle on the rest.      Rich is on a diet that allows 2100 calories per day. He consumes one-quarter of his calories at breakfast, and the rest throughout the day.      Caroline drove one-quarter of a 900-mile trip today. How far did she drive, and how far does she have left to go?        Other Ways to Write Fourths  Earlier we saw that we can write one-half in many different ways. For example, We can also write one-fourth and three-fourths in different ways.   of a dozen eggs (12 eggs) 3 eggs  clocks    of an hour (60 minutes) 45 minutes  clocks     When we write a fraction, the number that gives the \"part\" (the top) is called the numerator , and the number that gives the \"whole\" (the bottom) is called the denominator . For example, in the fraction , the numerator is 15 and the denominator is 60.  Definition  The denominator of a fraction (the bottom) tells us how many pieces are in one whole. The numerator (the top) tells us how many pieces are in the part.  Although it has a different numerator and denominator, the fraction is the same as , because 15 pieces are one-fourth of 60 pieces. Both fractions give the same portion of one whole. grid-fourth  Shade one-fourth of the grid. Then write and with the denominator for the whole grid.  4by6 grid and  8by2 grid and  5by4 grid and  8by6 grid and   6 by 4 grid with 6 shaded boxes  2 by 8 grid with 4 shaded boxes  4 by 5 grid with 5 shaded boxes  6 by 8 grid with 12 shaded boxes     Fractions on a Number Line  In the previous exercise we used grids to illustrate fractions. We can also show fractions of a distance on a number line .  Mark the fractions , , and of 12 on the number line below. number line  To find of 12, we divide by 2:  To find of 12, we divide by 4:  To find of 12, we multiply of 12 by 3:  Here is a number line showing the results: number line   From the previous Example, we see that A number line can help us visualize familiar fractions written with different denominators. Here is the number line from that Example, showing the fractions written with denominator 12. number line  Mark the fractions , , and of the distance on each number line, and write the fractions with the new denominator.  number line  number line  number line  number line   fractions of 8  , ,  fractions of 16 , ,  fractions of 20 , ,  fractions of 24 , ,     Benchmark Fractions  The fractions , , and are called benchmark fractions because we have a good intuitive feel for their size. We can estimate other fractions by comparing them to the benchmarks.  Of the 32 students in Ethan's math class, 9 are from out-of-state.   What fraction of Ethan's class is from out-of-state?  Is that fraction closer to , , or to of the class?     We write the fraction as Out-of-state students make up of Ethan's class.  Let's compute the benchmark fractions with denominator 32.    Now that we have written the benchmark fractions with the appropriate denominator, we can compare our fraction from part (a). We see that the fraction is slightly more than of the class.   In part (b) of the previous Example, do you see why  We can use a number line to compare fractions. Here are the fractions from the previous Example shown on a number line. number line  One yard is equal to 36 inches.  Compute the benchmark fractions with denominator 36.  Draw a number line showing the benchmark fractions from part (a). number line  Connie needs ribbons of length 10 inches and 25 inches. What fractions of a yard are those lengths?

We can represent one-tenth in several ways.   One out of ten   Recall that the first place after the decimal point is the .   Place values for 17.591   Ten hundredths is the same as one-tenth:    Can you explain why is another way to write ?  Major Motors plans to increase its workforce by one-tenth. They currently employ 260 people. How many new employees will they hire?  To find of 260, we divide by 10: Major Motors will hire 26 people.

Fractions in Tenths  One-tenth is a relatively small fraction. How do tenths compare to the benchmark fractions , , and ?   On the figure below, draw lines at , , and and label them.   Which is larger, or ?  Which is larger, or ?      If you can find one-tenth of an amount, you can find two-tenths, or three-tenths, and so on. Remember that can also be written as 0.2, can also be written as 0.3, and so on.  Of the 3200 students who commute at Lakeview College, 0.4 take the bus. How many students take the bus?  First we'll find of 3200. To find 0.4, or , of 3200, we can multiply of 3200 by 4. 1280 students take the bus.  In the Examples above, what do you notice about dividing a number by 10?

From 0 to 1 by tenths    When we rewrite a fraction with a smaller denominator (but so that the size of the fraction stays the same), we say that we have reduced the fraction.  Definition  To reduce a fraction, we rewrite it as an equivalent fraction with a smaller denominator.  For example, the fraction can be reduced to . You can see that these two fractions are equivalent — that is, they name the same portion of one whole.  We can reduce because both the numerator are the denominator are divisible by 2. If there are half as many pieces in the whole, (5 instead of 10), we take half as many in the part, (2 instead of 4), to make the same fraction.  How to Reduce a Fraction  To a fraction, we divide the numerator and the denominator by the same number.  Reduce the fraction .  Both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 4. Thus, .  Here is a picture of a spider on a circle. If we start at the top of the circle, at 0°, and travel once clockwise all the way around the circle, we turn through a rotation of 360°. Each of the spider's legs intersects the circle at a fraction of one complete rotation. Name the fraction at each leg, and reduce it if possible.   First leg:  Second leg:  Third leg:  Fourth leg:  Fifth leg:  Sixth leg:  Seventh leg:  Eighth leg:            Hundredths  What is one-tenth of one-tenth? One-tenth of one-tenth is one-hundredth, or . In decimal form, we write as 0.01, with the 1 in the second decimal place, or hundredths place .  Be careful with those zeros! Note that  When we read a decimal fraction, the denominator is given by the place of the digit. For example,   three-tenths  (3 is in the tenths place)   five-hundredths  (5 is in the hundredths place)   thirty-five-hundredths  (5 is in the hundredths place)   thirty-hundredths  (0 is in the hundredths place)  We can also say that there are ten hundredths in one tenth. You can check on your calculator that  All of the fractions we have studied so far can be written with denominator 100.  Write each decimal fraction as a common fraction, and reduce it if possible.                   Hundredths  Compare each decimal fraction to the closest familiar common fraction from the previous Exercise. Is it larger or smaller than the familiar fraction?  Of all registered voters in the county, 0.63 turned out for the election.  Megacorps finds that on any given day, 0.17 of their employees are absent.  Among single-parent families, 0.27 live in poverty.  The United States spends 0.48 of the amount spent on the military world-wide.   Decimal Form  We can find the decimal form for any fraction by dividing the denominator into the numerator. Remember that the fraction bar is really a division symbol. For instance, means \"divide one whole into four equal parts, and take one part.\" You can use a calculator to check the decimal forms of our benchmark fractions.  Benchmark Fractions as Decimals   Find the decimal form of .  We can use a calculator to divide the numerator by the denominator. You can check that , or , reduces to .

A classmate says that since 0.10 equals , it must be true that 0.20 equals . What do you think? Explain.  Problems 11-12 are true stories.   Kathy asks for 4 ounces of roast turkey at the deli counter, but the clerk tells her that the scale only measures in pounds. How should Kathy rephrase her order?  Kathy then asks for a fraction of a pound (instead of 4 ounces), but the clerk says that the scale only measures in decimal fractions. Now what should Kathy ask for?  lb  lb   Bob's mechanic says he knows that a wrench is bigger than a wrench because 78 is bigger than 34. Will the mechanic's method always work? Give an example.   For Problems 13-16, decide whether the fraction described is more or less than the given fraction. Show how you decided.  Tolstoy's War and Peace is 1440 pages long. Mandy has finished 150 pages. Is that more or less than of the book? less  A medium Caramel Mocha has 330 calories. Is that more or less than of a 1400 calorie diet?  The reflecting pool at the Washington monument is 2029 feet long. Is that more or less than of a mile? (How many feet are in a mile?) less  Peter picked 12 ounces of blueberries.

How many squares of baker's chocolate does she need?  Cora has a one-ounce square of unsweetened chocolate. What fraction of her recipe would that provide?  Noreen has saved $380, which is 0.2 of the amount she needs for a new washer and dryer. Her dad has offered to loan her half of the cost of the appliances. How much will he contribute? $950  According to the New York Times, in 2013, one-sixth of China's farmland, or about 50 million acres, was polluted by cadmium and other industrial waste. In 2014, the fraction of polluted farmland had increased to one-fifth. How many acres were polluted in 2014?   We can reduce a fraction if we can arrange the shaded and unshaded pieces into larger groups of equal size. For example, to reduce we form groups of four pieces each: For Problems 21-26, use the diagram to help you reduce the fraction.               For Problems 27-30, the grid has 10 rows and 10 columns. What fraction of the grid is shaded? Reduce your answer if possible.           For Problems 31-38, reduce the fraction if possible.           What does it mean for two fractions to be equivalent? They name the same part of one whole.  Explain why the fractions and cannot be reduced.  Why is a 25-cent coin called a quarter?  How many decades are there in a century?  Delbert's niece is 2 years 9 months old. Delbert says that is the same as 2.9 years old. Is he correct? Why or why not? No.  Francine's younger sister claims that 0.4 is the same as , and that 0.6 means . Do you agree? Why or why not?  On the number line below, place a dot at all halves, fourths, and fifths, and label each.  On the number line below, label each tick mark with a decimal fraction.  For Problems 47-50, write each fraction as an equivalent fraction in hundredths.  and  and  and  Explain how you know that of one whole is bigger than of one whole.    On the number line below, mark and label the decimal fractions located half-way between each pair of tick marks.  In the first row of the table below, write as a common fraction each of the decimal fractions you labeled in part (a). In the second row, reduce the fraction if possible.

Write your answer to part (a) as a common fraction.  Reduce your answer to part (b) if possible.  What is one-half of 0.1?  Is it true that 10 times 0.10 is equal to 0.100? Why or why not? No. They are equal.  Explain why it makes sense that is half of . (Hint: Think about what the denominator tells us.)  List all the fractions (between 0 and 1) with denominator 20 that cannot be reduced.    Which of the following numbers are equal to one-tenth?  Which of the following numbers are equal to one-hundredth?    Caleb says that you can double a fraction by multiplying numerator and denominator by 2. Is he correct? Give an example. No.  Janelle says that you can create an equivalent fraction by adding the same number to the numerator and the denominator. Do you think this is true?  Try this example:  Start with this fraction:  Add 1 to top and bottom:  Now rewrite both fractions with denominator 100:  Are the fractions equivalent?  Make up your own example.   If you know of an amount, how can you find of the amount? Give an example.  If you know of an amount, how can you find of the amount? Give an example.  Multiply by 5.  Multiply by 5, then divide by 2.    If you know of an amount, how can you find of the amount? Give an example.  If you know of an amount, how can you find of the amount? Give an example.  Recall that the third place after the decimal represents thousandths. For Problems 69-76, read each fraction aloud, then write it as a common fraction. Reduce the fraction if possible.

  "body": " Whole Numbers   Factors  Primes and Composites  Greatest Common Factor  Lowest Common Multiple    Factors  First let's review some vocabulary. Match each word with its definition.  Vocabulary  factor product divisible whole number   The result of multiplying two or more numbers together.  A counting number or zero.  Can be divided evenly (with no remainder) by another number.  A whole number that divides evenly into a given number.   Rectangles  For this Activity (and the Practice problems), you will need 40 small tiles.   Select 12 tiles from your collection. Can you make a rectangle using all 12 tiles? One possibility is a rectangle with length 4 tiles and height 3 tiles. Or we could arrange the rectangle with length 3 tiles and height 4 tiles.    What other rectangles can you make? Fill in the table below.        Length               Height    4  3  X   X  X  X  X  X    How many rectangles did you find? On the grid below, sketch all of your rectangles. Start each one in the bottom left-hand corner. The rectangles will overlap. What do you notice about the rectangles? (Hint: Draw in a diagonal on the grid, from bottom left to upper right.)    Repeat Problem 1 with a set of 24 tiles. Make your own table for Length and Height, and use the grid below to sketch your rectangles. (Note: two of your rectangles will not fit on the grid.)       Length       Height       How many rectangles did you find?   Can you think of two whole numbers whose product is 12? Can you think of another pair? Let's try the whole numbers in order, starting with 1. We are looking for factors of 12, or numbers that divide evenly into 12.        Length               Height  12  6  4  3  X  2  X  X  X  X  X  1   Do you see that these are the same numbers we found in Problem 1 of Activity 1.3.1? We have found three number pairs:   Each of these pairs of numbers is called a factor pair for 12. (The order of the numbers in a factor pair doesn't matter.)  Factor Pairs  Find all the factor pairs for each number. List them in order.        Which number above has the most factor pairs?  Which number above has the fewest factor pairs?   Definition  A counting number (larger than 1) that is evenly divisible only by 1 and itself is called a prime number. A counting number larger than 1 that is not prime is called composite .  Which of the following numbers are prime numbers?  Because 6 is divisible by 2 and 3, it is composite. Similarly, 2 and 5 are factors of 10, so it is composite also. But 7 has no factors other than 1 and 7, so it is prime. Similarly, 11 is prime.  Which of the following numbers are prime numbers? 5  In Activity 1.3.3 we'll find all the prime numbers between 1 and 100.  The Sieve of Eratosthenes   Circle the first prime number, 2. Cross out all multiples of 2.  Circle the first number that is not crossed out. (It should be a prime number.) Cross out all multiples of that number.  Repeat part (b) until there are no more numbers to cross out.   The circled numbers are the primes!    Primes and Composites  The prime numbers are important because they are the building blocks for the whole numbers: every composite number is a product of primes.  Write each composite number as a product of primes.         Write each composite number as a product of primes.        The list of prime numbers whose product is the original number is called the prime factorization of a composite number. To find the prime factorization of a larger number, we can use a factor tree .  Find the prime factorization of 60.  We begin by finding any factor pair for 60. For example, we might start with . We write each factor on a \"branch\" of the tree, as shown below:   Both 6 and 10 are composite numbers and can be factored further.   Now all the factors are prime numbers. These are the \"leaves\" of the factor tree. We circle each prime factor, and then write them in increasing order. The prime factorization of 60 is  It doesn't matter how we start a factor tree; we will always get the same prime factorization at the end. In the previous Example, we might have started the factor tree with and built the following tree.   You can see that we end up with the same prime factorization of 60.  Build a factor tree and write the prime factorization for 280.  There is only one prime factorization for any whole number.  Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic  Every whole number greater than 1 can be written in exactly one way as a prime number or as a product of primes.   Greatest Common Factor  We use factors when we work with fractions. Suppose we would like to reduce the fraction . We look for the largest number that divides evenly into both 15 and 24, or in other words, the largest number that is a factor of both 15 and 24. By listing all the factors of each number, we can see that the largest factor common to both 15 and 24 is .   We say that 3 is the greatest common factor or GCF for 15 and 24.  Definition  The greatest common factor or GCF of two whole numbers is the largest factor of both numbers.  Find the greatest common factor of 16 and 24.  We list all the factors of 16 and 24.   The numbers 16 and 24 have several common factors (namely, 1, 2, and 4), but the largest common factor is 8. The GCF of 16 and 24 is 8.   List all the factors of 18 and 24.   Find the GCF of 18 and 24.  18: 2, 3, 6, 9  24: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12  6   There is a faster way to find the GCF of two numbers, using their prime factorizations.  Use prime factorization to find the greatest common factor of 16 and 24.  Make factor trees to verify the factorizations of 16 and 24.  Now list all the factors that appear in the factorization of both numbers.   Finally, multiply together the factors that appear in both numbers. The GCF of 16 and 24 is  Do you see why this method works? By including all the factors that appear in both 18 and 24, we find the largest number that will divide evenly into both 18 and 24.  Use prime factorization to find the greatest common factor of 18 and 24.    Lowest Common Multiple  Tastee hot dogs come in packages of 8, and Tastee hot dog buns come in packages of 6. How many packages of each should you buy so that you won't have any hot dogs or buns left over?   Let's try some numbers. We are looking for the same number of hot dogs as buns.   We can stop here. If we buy 3 packages of hot dogs and 4 packages of buns, we'll have equal numbers of each: 24 hot dogs and 24 buns.  The numbers in the second row of the table are multiples of 8, and the numbers in the third row are multiples of 6. The number 24 is a common multiple of 6 and 8; in fact, it is the lowest common multiple . (You can check that 48 and 72 are also common multiples of 6 and 8.)  Definition  The lowest common multiple or LCM of two whole numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both whole numbers.  Find the lowest common multiple for 12 and 15.  We list multiples of each number until we find the smallest common multiple.   We see that 60 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 12 and 15. The LCM of 12 and 15 is 60.    Juicee hot dogs come in packages of 10, and Juicee hot dog buns come in packages of 8. How many packages of each should you buy so that you won't have any hot dogs or buns left over?  What is the LCM of 8 and 10?   4 packages of hot dogs and 5 packages of buns  40   We can use prime factorization to find LCM's, too.  Use prime factorization to find the lowest common multiple for 12 and 15  Make factor trees to verify the factorizations of 12 and 15.   Notice that we wrote the products so that common factors line up vertically.  Next we select one number from each column.   Finally, we multiply together all the factors that appear in either number.  Look carefully at the difference between using prime factorization to find the GCF and to find the LCM.   To find the GCF, we use the factors that occur in numbers.  To find the LCM, we use the factors that appear in number.  Use prime factorization to find the lowest common multiple of 18 and 24.   Factor Trees    Make a factor tree for 42.  Write the prime factorization for 42.   Make a factor tree for 60.  Write the prime factorization for 60.

  "body": " Angles and Triangles   Angles  Measuring Angles  Using a Protractor  Triangles  Sides and Angles    Angles  When two line segments meet at a point, they form an angle . The point where the two sides meet is called the vertex . Here are some angles.   Acute angles  You are probably familiar with a right angle , such as the corner of a square. Each of the corners of the tabletop below is a right angle. The two arms of a plus sign form four right angles. We say that the sides of a right angle are perpendicular .    Now imagine slowly opening a laptop computer until the two sides lie flat on the table. The two sides form an angle that gradually opens until the two covers form a straight line. We give different names to angles, depending on how open they are.     Kinds of Angles  If the sides are less open than a right angle, we call the angle acute .  If the sides are more open than a right angle, we call the angle obtuse .  If the two sides are totally open to form a straight line, we call the angle a straight angle .   Acute, obtuse, and straight angles  In the pictures below, the handles of the hedge clipper form an acute angle. The hands of the clock form an obtuse angle.    Acute, right, or obtuse? Choose the best answer for each angle in the photograph.   The ballerina's arms form a(n) angle.  The ballerina's legs form a(n) angle.  The male dancer's legs form a(n) angle.  obtuse  right  acute    Measuring Angles  We use degrees to measure how open an angle is. The symbol for a degree is . A right angle is 90 , and a straight angle is 180 .   Acute, obtuse, and straight angles  The degree measure of an acute angle is less than 90 , and the degree measure of an obtuse angle is between 90 and 180 .    Acute angles    Obtuse angles     Question What do you think an angle of 0 looks like?  The measure of an angle does not depend on the orientation of the angle, or on how long the sides are, or whether the angle is combined with other angles. It only depends on how open the sides are. Here are some pictures of 30 angles.   Thirty degree angles in different orientations   We use the symbol to stand for \"angle.\"  The picture shows two angles that together make a right angle. If the measure of is 25 , what is the measure of ?   Complementary angles   A right angle measures 90 , so the sum of plus must be 90 . Therefore, The measure of is 65 , or .  Find the measure of the unknown angle. Parts (a) and (b) show right angles.   Complementary angles    Complementary angles    Supplementary angles    Supplementary angles         Using a Protractor  We use a protractor to measure angles.   Protractor  Using a protractor to measure an angle  Place the center dot of the protractor at the vertex of the angle.  Line up the bottom line of the protractor along one of the sides of the angle.  Read the number where the other side of the angle meets the scale on the circular edge of the protractor.   Notice that the protractor has one scale that starts at the right edge and increases in the counterclockwise direction, and a second scale that starts on the left edge. That's so you can line up the first side of the angle in either direction from the center.  Use a protractor to measure this angle:   Acute angle   Place the protractor as shown below, with the vertex O in the center and side OB lined up along the bottom of the protractor.   Angle under protractor  Now follow the scale that increases from side OB up to side OA. In this case it is the inner scale. We see that side OA meets the inner scale at 40 . The measure of is 40 .  What is the measure of the obtuse angle shown below?   Obtuse angle under protractor   Measuring Angles   Use your straightedge to draw an acute angle. Use your protractor to find the degree measure of your angle.  Use your straightedge to draw an obtuse angle. Use your protractor to find the degree measure of your angle.  Use your protractor to find the degree measure of each angle.   Acute and obtuse angles    On another sheet of paper, use your straightedge to draw a triangle of any shape you like. Label the angles of your triangle A, B, and C.  Now cut or tear off the three angles and place the vertex of angle A on the dot below.  Next place the vertex of angle B at the dot so that one of its sides touches one of the sides of angle A. Repeat with angle C.  What do you notice about the sum of the three angles? Write it below:    Triangles  Triangles come in various shapes, depending on the size of their angles or the lengths of their sides. Here are the names of some triangles classified by the size of their angles.  Triangles   A right triangle has one right angle.  In an acute triangle , all three angles are acute.  In an obtuse triangle , one of the angles is obtuse.   Some right triangles   Three right triangles   Some acute triangles   Three acute triangles   Some obtuse triangles   Three obtuse triangles    Identify each triangle as right, acute, or obtuse. The little square indicates that the angle is .    30-60-90 triangle    Obtuse triangle    Acute triangle    Right triangle    Acute triangle    Acute triangle    right  obtuse  acute  right  obtuse  acute   Here are the names of some triangles classified by the lengths of their sides.  Triangles   All three sides of an equilateral triangle are equal in length.  In an isosceles triangle , two sides are equal in length.  In a scalene triangle , all three sides have different lengths.    An equilateral triangle.   Two acute triangles   Some isosceles triangles.   Three isosceles triangles   Some scalene triangles.   Three scalene triangles   Identify each triangle as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. Sides that have the same number of little hatch marks are equal in length.

In the triangle below, side is opposite the 120 angle, and it is the longest side. Side , which is the shortest side, is opposite the 20 angle.   Triangle with angles 20 deg, 40 deg, 120 deg and opposite sides b, a, c  In fact, because , we know that .   The symbol means \"is greater than.\" So, means \" is greater than , which is greater than .\"  Similarly, the symbol means \"is less than.\"  These symbols are called inequality symbols (as opposed to equals signs), and sentences such as are called inequalities (as opposed to equations).  Inequality Symbols  means \"is greater than\"  means \"is less than\"  Write an inequality about the angles in the triangle below.   Triangle with sides 10, 14, and 16   Sides and Angles  In any triangle, the angle opposite the longest side is the largest angle, and the angle opposite the shortest side is the smallest angle.  What about triangles that have equal sides, namely isosceles and equilateral triangles? The angles opposite equal sides must also be equal.  Definition  In an isosceles triangle, the two equal angles (the ones opposite the equal sides) are called the base angles , and the third angle (the one included between the equal sides) is called the vertex angle .   Triangle with two equal sides and two equal angles   The triangle below is isosceles. What is the measure of the other base angle, and what is the measure of the vertex angle?   Triangle with two sides of length 12 and base angle 38 deg   The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal, so the other base angle is 38 . To find the vertex angle, we recall that the sum of all the angles in a triangle is 180 , so the vertex angle must be    The vertex angle of the isosceles triangle below is 120 . What is the measure of each base angle?   Triangle with two sides of length 12 and base angle 38 deg   What is the measure of each angle of an equilateral triangle?    Here are the facts we have discovered about angles in triangles. Angles in Triangles  The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 .  The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal.

Is it possible for a triangle to have more than one obtuse angle? Why or why not? No. The sum of the angles would be more than 180°.  What can you say about the sum of the two acute angles in a right triangle?  The word \"vertex\" has several meanings in mathematics. Describe two ways it is used in this lesson. The point where the two sides of an angle meet, and the angle between the equal sides of an isosocelels triangle.  Can two acute angles add up to a straight angle? Why or why not?

  "body": " Perimeter and Area   Perimeter  Area  Estimating Area    Perimeter  When we speak of the perimeter of a region, we usually mean the outer edge or boundary of the region. In mathematics, the perimeter means the length of that boundary.   To find the perimeter of the region at right we add up the lengths of its sides: The perimeter of the region is 20 inches.   Imagine that you are walking around the edge of the region. (If it is a very small region, imagine that you are an ant walking around the region.) The distance that you walk in one circuit around the region is its perimeter.   One reason you might want to find a perimeter is to calculate the amount of fence you need to surround a region. Find the perimeter of the community garden shown below. 267 ft  Perimeter  To find the perimeter of a straight-sided figure:  Measure the length of each side.  Add up the lengths of the sides.  Perimeter   Find a straight-sided object near you. (Maybe a book, or a table-top? How about something more interesting, with more sides?) Make a sketch of your object below. Now use a ruler or yardstick to calculate the object's perimeter. First find the perimeter in inches, and then in centimeters.  Sketch  Perimeter in inches:  Perimeter in centimeters:  Label the length, in centimeters, of each side of the triangle. Then find its perimeter.   Perimeter in centimeters:   Perimeter in centimeters:  On the centimeter grid below, sketch two rectangles with different shapes that each have a perimeter of 20 centimeters. Label the dimensions (the length and the width) of each rectangle.  How can we find the perimeter of a figure if the sides are not straight? Well, we could use a tape measure, or we could wrap a string around the edge of the figure, then measure the length of the string.    Area  Here are two rectangles with the same perimeter. They represent garden plots for blueberry bushes, and the lines in the grids represent measurements in yards. You can check that both rectangles have a perimeter of 24 yards, so both garden plots require the same amount of fence to keep out the deer.   Which garden plot has the most room for blueberry bushes inside, Garden A or Garden B? Suppose that each blueberry bush fills one square on the grid. Which rectangle encloses the most squares? Garden B has more room inside. The number of squares that fit inside a perimeter is called the area of the region enclosed. We measure area in square units ; in this case, square yards. The area of Garden A is 27 square yards, and the area of Garden B is 36 square yards.  Definition  A square unit is just a square that measures 1 unit on each side. The figure below shows 1 square inch and 1 square centimeter.   We cannot use the same units to measure both area and perimeter. The units for perimeter, such as inches or miles, measure length. For area we need units that measure space. For area, we use square units.  The more square units that fit inside a region, the larger its area!  Find the area of the figure below. Each square in the grid represents one square foot.   It may be easier to count the squares inside the figure if we partition it into 3 rectangular pieces, like this: Now we can count the number of square feet in each piece. The total number of squares inside the figure is The area of the figure is 34 square feet.  Question: Would the figure in the previous Example have the same area if you rearranged the pieces as shown below?  Find the area of the figure below. The lines on the grid represent centimeters. 24 sq cm  Do you see the difference between area and perimeter?  measures the of a region.  measures the amount of the region.  Perimeter is measured in linear units, and area is measured in square units. For example, the perimeter of the figure shown at right is 4 inches, and its area is 1 square inch.   Find the perimeter and area of each figure. Each square measures 1 centimeter on each side.          perim = 6 cm, area = 2 sq cm  perim = 8 cm, area = 3 sq cm  perim = 10 cm, area = 4 sq cm  perim = 10 cm, area = 4 sq cm  perim = 7 cm, area = 3 sq cm    Estimating Area  What if square units don't fit evenly inside a region?  Find the area of the triangle. The grid represents inches.   This is actually an easy example, because the diagonal side of the triangle cuts each unit square in half. So we can pair up the 6 half-squares to make 3 whole squares. Adding those squares to the 15 whole squares, we find that the area is  Here is another way to find the area of the triangle in the last Example. Note that the triangle is actually half of a rectangle, as shown at right. The rectangle has 6 rows of 6 squares each, so its area is The area of the triangle is half of that, or 18 square inches.   The method described in the Note above is useful in many situations. We can enclose the figure in a rectangle, and subtract the areas that are not inside the region.  Find the area enclosed by the octagon shown below. The grid represents centimeters.   Imagine enclosing the octagon in a rectangle, as shown at right. You can check that the rectangle encloses 7 rows of squares, and each row is 7 squares long. Thus, the area of the rectangle is Now we just need to subtract the areas of the four \"corners\" of the rectangle.   By looking at the top left corner, perhaps you can see that each of the four corners is half of a square whose area is 4 square centimeters. So each corner has an area of 2 square centimeters, and all four corners have a total area of 8 square centimeters.  Finally, we subtract the area of the corners from the area of the rectangle, and what's left is the area inside the octagon:  Find the area of the parallelogram . Enclose the figure in a rectangle, then subtract the areas that are not inside the parallelogram. The grid represents centimeters.  22 sq cm  We have investigated three different ways to calculate the area of a region.  Some methods for calculating area:   Count the unit squares enclosed in the region, including your estimate of the number of whole squares made up of partial squares.  Use multiplication to calculate the number of unit squares inside a rectangle.  Enclose the region in an imaginary rectangle, calculate the area of the rectangle, and then subtract the areas of the parts outside the region.   Area  In this Activity, all grids represent centimeters.   Estimate the area of each region by piecing together squares as necessary.     Use the fact that a triangle is half of a rectangle to find the area of each region. Hint: It may help to draw in a useful vertical line (or two).     Find the area of each region by enclosing it in a rectangle and subtracting the areas of the parts outside the region. Show your method.       Vocabulary   perimeter  area  square unit  vertical line    Practice 1.5   On the centimeter grids below, draw three rectangles of different sizes and shapes.

Do all of the rectangles in Problem 9 have the same area?  What do you notice about the sum of the length plus the width of each rectangle?    For Problems 11-12, use a ruler to measure the length of each side.   First measure in inches. Round your measurements to the nearest quarter-inch. Then calculate the perimeter of the figure.  Then measure in centimeters. Round your measurements to the nearest half-centimeter.

  "body": " Decimal Numbers   Place Value  Comparing Decimal Fractions  Fractions to Decimals  Rounding and Estimating    The Metric System  Let's compare the imperial (everyday, American) system of units with the metric system .        Imperial System  Metric System     1 mile = 1760 yards  1 kilometer = 1000 meters   1 yard = 3 feet  1 meter = 100 centimeters   1 foot = 12 inches  1 centimeter = 10 millimeters     1 ton = 2000 pounds  1 kilogram = 1000 grams   1 pound = 16 ounces  1 gram = 100 centigrams   1 ounce = 437.5 grams  1 centigram = 10 milligrams     1 gallon = 4 quarts  1 liter = 100 centiliters   1 quart = 2 pints  1 centiliter = 100 milliliters   Notice two properties of the metric system:   Each larger unit is 10, 100 or 1000 times a smaller one.  The names of related units all use \"kilo,\" \"centi,\" or \"milli.\"  For example, the basic unit of length in the metric system is the meter . Smaller units of length are always one-tenth as long as the previous one.   The picture below shows a portion of a meter stick.  The metric system is easy to use because it fits with our base-10 number system. In the same way, decimal fractions are easy to use.   Place Value  Remember the place values in our base-10 number system. For example,  The places after the decimal point represent fractions of a whole number, and it is important to remember that:  Decimal Fractions   Place Value  Complete the table.       Decimal Fraction  Common Fraction  Words     four hundredths             one thousandth             eight hundredths            Be careful when reading decimal fractions! Remember that the position or place value of a digit tells us the denominator of the fraction. In the same way, 4 and 40 and 400 are very different numbers.  Here is a way to think of decimal fractions. Imagine that the 10 by 10 by 10 block shown below represents one whole.  Then one horizontal slice of the block (a \"flat\") represents one tenth of one whole. One row of the flat (a \"stick\") represents one hundredth, and one small cube represents one thousandth.  There are ten flats in a whole, ten sticks in a flat, and ten cubes in a stick. Or, in other words, a flat is one tenth of a whole, a stick is one tenth of a flat, and a cube is one tenth of a stick.  Decimal Places   Use blocks to represent the decimal fraction 0.253 as part of one whole.  We read the fraction as \"two hundred fifty-three thousandths.\" (Note that the last digit, 3, is in the thousandths place.)  We can analyze the fraction as follows: Here is the picture of the fraction.   You can check that there are 253 small cubes (thousandths) total.  What decimal fraction does this picture represent? 0.636   Comparing Decimal Fractions  A study published in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" found that \"calculation and decimal point errors accounted for approximately 15% of all prescribing errors in a tertiary care teaching hospital\" and \"for almost 70% of all detected medication prescribing errors among children.\"  Everyone should understand how decimal fractions represent portions of a whole.   Write these decimal fractions in order of size, from smallest to largest.  We'll look at the place values in each fraction. It might be helpful to picture each fraction using blocks, as demonstrated in Example 1.  We first look at the tenths place; a fraction with more tenths is larger than a fraction with fewer tenths. Thus, 0.4 is the largest fraction in this group, and 0.058 is the smallest.  Next we consider the hundredths place to see that 0.36 is larger than 0.325, because 6 hundredths is larger than 2 hundredths. Thus, the correct order from smallest to largest is Here are the four fractions shown on a number line.    Do not make the of thinking that 0.325 is larger than 0.36 because 325 is larger than 36! Remember to compare decimal fractions one decimal place at a time: tenths, then hundredths, etc.  Plot the fractions on the number line.   From 0 to 1 by hundredths   From 0 to 1 by hundredths   Another common is to think that 0.058 is larger than 0.4, because \"zero doesn't count.\" But in this case the zero tells us that while Once again, we compare decimal fractions by comparing each place value in order.  A Quick Fractions Refresher  There is more than one way to write any particular fraction. For example, the following fractions are all equivalent to : because each reduces to .  Write three fractions equivalent to .  Similarly, there is more than one way to write any particular decimal fraction. The following decimal fractions are equivalent: and so on. Each of these fractions reduces to , or 0.7. Note that the denominator of each decimal fraction is given by the place value of the last digit after the decimal point.   Write each decimal fraction as a common fraction.  Which fractions are equal?    The denominator of each fraction is given by the place value of the last digit after the decimal point.  The fractions 0.30 and 0.300 are both equal to . The fractions 0.03 and 0.030 are both equal to . We see that an extra zero at the end of a decimal fraction does not change its value.   Explain why 0.15 and 0.150 are equivalent fractions, but 0.150 and 0.015 are not equivalent.  , and , which can be reduced to , so those two fractions are equal. (Both are equivalent to .) But .   Fractions to Decimals  Another way to get a feel for decimal fractions is to relate them to familiar common fractions. Remember that the fraction bar is actually a division symbol, so the fraction means \"1 divided by 2.\" If you use your calculator to carry out the division, you will find Some decimal equivalents of common fractions terminate or end, like but others repeat a pattern of digits without ending, like We denote these repeating decimals with a bar over the digits that repeat, like this:  Write the decimal equivalent of the fraction .  We use a calculator to compute  We write the result with a repeater bar: .  Write the decimal equivalent of the fraction .  Decimal Equivalents   Use your calculator to find the decimal equivalent of each common fraction. Use a repeater bar to denote any repeating decimals.       Fraction  Decimal  Fraction  Decimal                                      Plot each decimal fraction on the number line below.   Which of the fractions above are repeating decimals?    Question  Is there a way to tell which fractions have terminating decimals, and which ones have repeating decimals?   Rounding and Estimating  My town has a population of 8300 people. Is that closer to 8000 people or 9000 people? If we count by 100's, 8300 is closer to 8000.   So if I round the population to 1000's of people, my town's population is about 8000. In fact, we can say that any population less than 8500 is about 8000, and a population 8500 or above is about 9000.  Is 0.837 closer to 0.8 or to 0.9?  In this Example, we are rounding to the nearest tenth. We use the same reasoning as above: because 3 is less than 5, 0.8 7 is closer to 0.8.   In the last example, we rounded down to the nearest tenth. To decide which way to round, we looked at the next digit, in the hundredths place, to see if it was greater than or less than 5. We did not have to consider the 7 in the thousandths place -- it is too small to make a difference in this case.  We can round a number to any place-value we like. In the next Exercise, we round to the hundredths place.  Round 0.258 to hundredths. (Is 0.258 closer to 0.25 or to 0.26?) Illustrate on the number line.   From 0.25 to 0.26 From 0.25 to 0.26 by 0.0001  Rounding  Fill in the blanks.   When we round to the nearest tenth, we look at the digit in the place. If that digit is less than , we round to the smaller tenth. If that digit is or greater, we round up to the larger tenth.  When we round to the nearest hundredth, we look at the digit in the place. If that digit is less than , we round to the smaller hundredth. If that digit is or greater, we round up to the larger hundredth.  When we round to any place value, we look at the digit to the of that place. If that digit is less than , we . If that digit is or greater, we .    Find the decimal form of each fraction. Round your answers to hundredths.      We use a calculator to divide 3 by 7. To round to hundredths, we look at the digit after the hundredths place, which in this case is 8. If that digit is 5 or more, we round up to the next hundredth, to get 0.43. So, is approximately 0.43.  We use a calculator to divide 5 by 7. The digit after the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down to 0.71. So, is approximately 0.71.   To understand rounding, we need to think about place value. In Example 6(a), the number is between and , but it is closer to 0.430, just as 28 is closer to 30 than it is to 20. So we round up to 0.430, or just 0.43.  In part (b), the number is between and , but it is closer to 0.710, just as 14 is closer to 10 than it is to 20. So we round down to 0.710, or just 0.71.  In Example 6, it is important to realize that is to 0.43; it is only to 0.43. Whenever we round off a decimal fraction, the result is always an approximation.  Write the decimal form of each fraction. Round to hundredths if the decimal does not terminate. Is this decimal form exactly equal to the fraction, or an approximation?       Fraction  Decimal Form  Equal (Yes or No)                                Fraction  Decimal Form  Equal (Yes or No)     Yes     Yes     No     No     Yes     No   How big is one centimeter? A centimeter is 0.393701 of one inch. Round this fraction to the nearest tenth, and compare it to the decimal equivalents of common fractions in Activity 2.  To round to tenths we look at the digit in the hundredths place. Because 9 is greater than 5, we round up to 0.4.   A centimeter is approximately 0.4 of one inch. By consulting Activity 2, we see that 0.4 is equal to . (Or we can reduce to .) So one centimeter is a little smaller than of an inch.    One kilometer is 0.621371 of one mile. How many miles long is a 10K (10 kilometer) race?

  "body": " More Fractions and Percents   Percents  Calculating Percents  What Percent Is It?  Eighths  Thirds  Decimal Form of One-Third    Percents  A percent is a fraction. For example, \"Percent\" means \"for each 100\" or \"out of 100.\" So a percent is just a fraction whose denominator is 100. If you understand hundredths, you also understand percents!   Jaycee is an interior designer and takes a 10% commission on the cost of a remodel. A recent remodel cost $12,500. How much is Jaycee's commission?  10% means \"ten out of 100\" or , and reduces to . To find of 12,500, we divide by 10: Jaycee's commission is $1250.  Because 10% is equal to it is easy to find 10% of a number: we just divide the number by 10. Once we know 10% of a number, we can find other percents. For example, to find 20% of a number we can compute 10% of the number and then double the result.  Viktor used a coupon for 10% off the price of hiking boots and saved $12.00. Find the following percents of the price of the boots.   5%  20%  25%  1%  3%  100%   $6  $24  $30  $1.20  $3.60  $120   Percents  Follow the steps to find each percent. Try to do the calculations in your head!   The Kwans are buying a house for $340,000, and they want to make a down payment of 20% of the price.   What is 10% of the price of the house?  What is 20% of the price of the house?   The restaurant bill came to $26, and Tyrell wants to leave a 15% tip.   What is 10% of the bill?  What is 5% of the bill?  What is 15% of the bill?   The sales tax on a $25 rose bush is 8%.   What is 10% of the price of the rose bush?  What is 1% of the price of the rose bush?  What is 8% of the price of the rose bush?   In 2020 there were approximately 72 million children under the age of 18 in the United States. About 16% of them lived in poverty.   What was 10% of the US population of children?  What was 5% of the US population of children?  What was 1% of the US population of children?  What was 16% of the US population of children?     Calculating Percents  Because \"percent\" means \"per 100,\" we can change a percent to a decimal fraction by dividing it by 100. You can use your calculator, or, even better, you can remember that to divide by 100 we move the decimal point 2 places to the left.  Change 12% to a decimal fraction.  12% means twelve hundredths, so we divide 12 by 100. We move the decimal point 2 places to the left.   We see that 12% is equal to 0.12.  To change a percent to a decimal fraction:  Divide the percent by 100, Move the decimal point two places to the left.  Even Easier! You can also think of the % sign as \"hundredths,\" so that we read 12% as \"twelve hundredths\" and write the fraction 0.12.  Change each percent to a decimal fraction.   50%  5% (Be careful!)  23%  99%  12.5%  200%   0.5  0.05  0.23  0.99  0.125  2.00   In Checkpoint 2.2.4 above, do you see the difference between the decimal forms of 50% and 5%? Try one yourself. Write the decimal form of each percent:  Now we can find any percent of a number.  The sales tax in Florida is 6%. What is the sales tax on a TV that costs $458?  We'd like to find 6% of $458. We must first change 6% to a decimal fraction by moving the decimal point 2 places to the left. (Note that we inserted a zero in front of 6 so that we could move the decimal point 2 places to the left!)  Next, we multiply 0.06 times 458. The sales tax is $27.48.  In Example 2.2.6, why does multiplying by 0.06 give us 6 hundredths of 458? Here's why:  To find one hundredth of 458 we divide by 100:  To find six hundredths of 458 we multiply 4.58 by 6:  You can check with your calculator that multiplying 458 by 0.06 is the same as multiplying by 6 and dividing by 100!  To calculate a percent of a number   Change the percent to a decimal fraction.  Multiply the number by the decimal fraction.  Calculate the sales tax.

If you follow a diet of 2000 calories per day, your minimum daily requirement (MDR) of potassium is 3500 milligrams.  A bowl of Cheerios provides 140 milligrams of potassium. What percent of your MDR is that?   We'd like to know what percent is 140 out of 3500. Remember that a percent is a fraction, so we make a fraction with the part (140) out of the whole (3500). As a decimal fraction, Cheerios provides 0.04, or 4 hundredths of the MDR for potassium. Four hundredths is the same as 4%. (Or you can multiply 0.04 by 100 to write it as a percent: )  To find what percent a part is   Divide the part by the whole.  Multiply the decimal fraction by 100.   Calculate the percent of each MDR provided by Cheerios.

Along the way we also encountered fifths. Here is another familiar and useful fraction.  Nelson bought a quarter-pound of sliced roast beef and ate half of it for lunch. How many ounces of roast beef did he eat? What fraction of a pound is that?   There are 16 ounces in a pound, so a quarter-pound is Half of 4 ounces is 2 ounces, so Nelson ate 2 ounces of roast beef. As a fraction of a pound, 2 ounces is Two ounces is lb, or one-eighth of a pound.  Recall that is one-half of . Now we see that is one-half of . You know that the decimal form of is 0.25 (or 0.250). What is the decimal form of ?   Find the decimal and percent equivalents for each eighth. Then shade the corresponding fraction of the figure.

Devon and Darla Grant together make $3200 per month in take-home pay. They are looking for an apartment, and don't want to spend more than 37.5% of their income on housing. What is the maximum rent they can afford?  We'll solve this problem in two different ways. First, we'll compute 37.5% of $3200. We write the percent as a decimal fraction and use a calculator to multiply: The Grants can afford $1200 monthly rent.  We can compute the fraction without a calculator if we remember that 37.5% is the same as . We first find of $3200 by dividing by 8: Then we multiply by 3 to find of 3200: We get the same answer, and we can do the calculations mentally!  Devon and Darla from Example 2.2.14 have budgeted their $3200 monthly income as follows.       Category  Percent  Fraction  Amount   Housing  37.5%     Food and Clothing  25%     Auto and Insurance  12.5%     Entertainment  15%     Savings  10%     Total       Compute the amount they can spend in each category. Try to do each calculation in your head, by using fractions whenever possible!  Check your calculations by computing the total in each column.

Many fields have a \"one-third\" rule as a guideline.  In photography, the one-third rule suggests that an image should be divided into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, and important elements of the picture, including the horizon, should be placed on the division lines or their intersections.  Zack plans to enlarge the farming scene below into a 24-inch by 15-inch photograph. If he crops the photo according to the one-third rule, how far will the base of the tree be from the right-side edge of the picture?   One-third of 24 is 8, so the base of the tree should be 8 inches from the edge of the picture.  Apply the one-third rule to each situation.   When a home-buyer applies for a mortgage, the monthly payments on the mortgage amount should not exceed one third of the buyer's net monthly salary. Brandon's net annual salary is $48,600. What size mortgage payment can he afford?  A manager should allow herself up to one third of the available time for a task to organize the task and delegate responsibility, thus allowing her team the remaining two thirds of the time. Emily has two hours to write her weekly report. How long should her team work on the report?  In scuba diving, one third of the gas supply is used for the outward journey, one third for the return journey, and one third is left as a safety reserve. Farah's cylinder holds 10 liters. How many liters are left when she starts her return journey?  When mowing grass, you should never remove more than one third of the grass blade. If the mowing height on your lawn mower is 3 inches, how tall should the grass be when you mow, so that you remove one third of the grass blade?   $1700  hour, or 1 hour and 20 minutes  liters, or liters  inches    Decimal Form of One-Third  What about the decimal form of ? Remember that some fractions do not \"come out evenly\" in their decimal form. One-third is one of those fractions. Use your calculator to verify that where the … symbol indicates that the 3's go on forever. (Recall that we encountered repeating decimals in . We can represent with a repeater bar as ) This is the exact value of as a decimal fraction. We often round the decimal form to hundredths and say that Similarly, you can verify that the exact value of is or and by rounding to hundredths we see that From here we can say that  Can we write exact percent values for and ? Try the following calculation:  To write as a percent: divide 100 by 3 by hand (that is, without a calculator!). You should find that If we double this number we find the percent form of : We have found exact percent forms for and .  Thirds as Percents   You should become familiar these percent values, so that you will recognize and when you see them!  Percents as Fractions  Complete the table by entering the (reduced) common fraction equivalent to each percent, and then computing that fraction of 120.

The temperature and humidity of the environment change day-by-day, as do prices on the stock market. We monitor our blood pressure and cholesterol count to detect changes in our health. The connections between variable quantities help us understand the forces that shape our world.   Consider the table below. Do you see a pattern that relates Delbert's age to Francine's age?       Francine's age  Delbert's age   10  16   13  19   17  23   Yes: Delbert's age is always six more than Francine's age.  Write a mathematical sentence that expresses Delbert's age in terms of Francine's age.    In the example above, Francine's age and Delbert's age are variables .  Definition  A variable is a numerical quantity that can take on different values at different times or in different situations.  Quantities that do not change, such as the six-year age difference between Delbert and Francine, are called constants .  The table shows the regular price, in dollars, of several items at a sporting goods store, and the discount price with a coupon.       Regular Price ($)  Discount Price ($)   9.99  7.99   10.99  8.99   11.49  9.49    Is there a pattern that relates the discount price to the regular price?  Write a mathematical sentence that expresses the discount price in terms of the regular price.  Discount price =   Yes, the discount price is $2 less than the regular price.  Discount price Regular price $2   Looking for Patterns  Did you see the pattern relating the Discount price to the Regular price in Checkpoint 2.2.3? When we look for a pattern we can check several possibilities:   Is there a constant number we can add to or subtract from the first variable to get the second variable?  Can we multiply or divide the first variable by a constant to get the second variable?  Is the sum or the product of the two variables a constant?    In the table below, do you see a pattern that relates the total utility bill to your share?       Utility Bill ($)  Your Share ($)   28  7   36  9   42  10.50   Yes: Your share is one fourth of the total bill, so you can divide the total bill by 4 to find your share.  Write a mathematical sentence that expresses your share of the bill in terms of the total bill.   In Example 2.3.4, Your Share and Utility Bill are variables, because they can change from month to month.  The table shows the weight of a salad and the price charged by the cafeteria.       Weight (oz)  Price ($)   4  0.40   6  0.60   8  0.80    Is there a pattern that relates the price of the salad to its weight?  Write a mathematical sentence that expresses the price of the salad in terms of its weight.  Price =   Yes, the price is 0.10 times the weight in ounces.  Price = 0.10 Weight   Find the Rule  Complete each table, then write a mathematical sentence relating the variables.        Revenue ($)  Profit ($)   1000  800   850  650   500  300   400    Profit =       Price ($)  Tax ($)   100  8   150  12   175  14   200    Tax =       Gas Used (gal)  Gas Left (gal)   1.5  18.5   4.2  15.8   12.5  7.5   15.6    Gas Left =       Length(in)  Width (in)   2  18   3  12   4  9   6    Width =    Bar Graphs  We can use a bar graph to display the values of a variable. The height of the bar illustrates the value at each time or in each situation.  The bar graph shows the number of new homes sold each month in Columbus County last year.    What variable is shown in this graph?  How many houses were sold in March?  In which month(s) were 35 houses sold?  In which month were the most houses sold, and how many houses were sold that month?  How much did housing sales decline from October to November?   Refer to the bar graph in Example 2.3.6, which shows new home sales in Columbus County.   How many houses were sold in February?  In which month(s) were 20 houses sold?  In which month were the fewest houses sold, and how many houses were sold that month?  Fill in the table showing the number of new homes sold each month.       Month  Houses Sold  Month  Houses Sold   January   July    February   August    March   September    April   October    May   November    June   December     15  March, April, and September  December, 5  Fill in the table showing the number of new homes sold each month.

In the 1990's, when cell phones first became available, Motorola and Nokia were competing phone companies. The bar graph shows the portion of the market captured by each company from 1994 to 2000.     What was Motorola's share of the market in 2000?  In which year shown did Motorola have a 24% market share?  In which of the years shown did Motorola have its largest market share? What was that share?  By how much did Motorola's market share exceed Nokia's in 1995?  In which of the years shown did Motorola have its largest lead over Nokia in market share? What was that lead?   Refer to the bar graph in Example 2.3.8.   What was Nokia's share of the market in 2000?  In which of the years shown did Nokia have its lowest market share? What was that share?  In which of the years shown did Nokia have its largest lead over Motorola in market share? What was that lead?  In which year did Nokia overtake Motorola in market share?   31%  1997, 19%  2000, 16%  1998   Making a Bar Graph  The table shows the age distribution of the U.S. population in 1900 and in 2015.       Age Group  % of Population in 1900  % of Population in 2015   Under 14  34  12   15 t0 24  20  21   25 to 44  28  26   45 to 54  14  26   5 and over  4  15    Which was the largest age group in 1900? In 2015?  What percent of the population was under 25 in 1900? In 2015?  What percent of the population was over 44 in 1900? In 2015?  Make a double bar graph displaying the information in the table.  In your opinion, what is the most striking change in the age distribution of the U. S. population form 1900 to 2015? How is that change illustrated by the bar graph?    Using Letters for Variables  We often use a single letter to represent a variable quantity. In Example 2.3.10, the variables are Jayson's age and Shawna's age.  Shawna was 22 years old when her son Jayson was born.   Fill in the table.       Jayson's age  1  4  7  12  18   (Calculation)        Shawna's age  23  26  29  34  40   Explain how to find Shawna's age if you know Jayson's age.  Write a mathematical sentence for Francine's age.  Let stand for Jayson's age, and write an expression for Shawna's age in terms of .  Check that your expression for Shawna's age gives the correct values when we replace Jayson's age by in the table in part (a).        1  4  7  12  18    23  26  29  34  40    A letter used as a variable must always stand for a number. In Example 2.3.10, the variable stands for Jayson's age, which is a number. We cannot let a variable stand for, say, \"Jayson,\" or for any other person or object.

  "body": " Algebraic Expressions   Sums and Products  Differences and Quotients  Using Algebraic Expressions  Evaluating Algebraic Expressions  Writing Algebraic Expressions    What is an Algebraic Expression?  In Section 2.3 we saw that we can use a letter to represent a variable quantity, such as temperature or age. Now we'll see how to work with variables to describe changing situations and to solve problems.  Our first task is to describe variable situations in mathematical language. When we use operation symbols to combine numbers and variables, we create algebraic expressions . Some examples of algebraic expressions are   For example, the expression might stand for 8 dollars more than the bill, and is often used to represent rate (or speed) times time.  Remember that a variable really is a number, but one whose value is unknown or not specified.   Sums and Products   When we add two numbers or variables together, the result is called the sum , and the things added together are called terms .  When we multiply two numbers or variables together, the result is called the product , and the things multiplied together are called factors .    Products  In algebra, we can use a raised dot or parentheses instead of a cross to indicate multiplication. For example, we write \"two times three\" as We write the product of two variables, or a number and a variable, next to each other without any symbol between them. For example,  Ways to Write Multiplication  Write each product in two other ways.       Six times                          Write each phrase as an algebraic expression.   The product of 0.05 and  The sum of and  The product of and  The sum of and          In Example 2.4.2a, we do not write a dot or parentheses between 0.05 and . The simplest way of writing an algebraic expression is usually best.  We could also write , because we can multiply the factors in either order. However, in algebra we prefer to write the number before the variable in a product.  In Example 2.4.2b, we could also write . In a sum, it does not matter which term is written first.   Write each phrase as an algebraic expression.   The sum of and 1.3  The product of 1.07 and       Differences and Quotients  When we subtract one number or variable from another, the result is called the difference . Here are two common ways to describe subtraction.  Differences    When we divide one number or variable by another, the result is called the quotient . In algebra, we often use a fraction bar instead of the symbol to denote division. For example,  Quotients    The fraction bar and the symbol both mean \"divided by.\"   Unlike addition, in subtraction it does matter which term appears first:  does not mean the same thing as .  The order of the numbers also matters in division:  but   We can switch the order of the two numbers in a sum or in a product, but we cannot switch them in a difference or a quotient. We say that the operations of addition and multiplication are commutative , but subtraction and division are not commutative.  Division  Here are three different ways to write the division \"Fifteen divided by three\": Look carefully at the order of the numbers in each expression.  Ways to Write Division  Write each quotient in three other ways. The first one is done for you.       94 divided by 6                divided by 8                           Write each phrase as an algebraic expression.   16 subtracted from  divided by 6  The difference of and  The quotient of and     or   or   Sometimes English phrases can be tricky. We must be especially careful with subtraction and division.   In part (a) of Example 2.4.6, the expression is not a correct answer.  In part (b) of Example 2.4.6, \" divided by 6\" means , but \" divided into 6\" means .   Another common way of referring to division uses the word ratio .  Definition  The ratio of to is the quotient .   For example, the \"ratio of to 100\" means the quotient .  Write each phrase as an algebraic expression.   The ratio of 100 to  subtracted from 19.95       Using Algebraic Expressions  There are usually several different ways to write an algebraic expression in English. Here are some English phrases that are used for each of the four arithmetic operations.  English to Math   Addition       English phrase  Algebraic expression   The sum of 5 and    Three more than    increased by 5    15 plus    The total of 8 and    added to 12    1.7 greater than    Exceeds by 3    Subtraction       English phrase  Algebraic expression   The difference of and 2    Five less than    minus 2.5    Nine reduced by    subtracted from    decreased by 16    Multiplication       English phrase  Algebraic expression   The product of 6 and    Five times    Three-quarters of    Twice    Eight percent of    Division       English phrase  Algebraic expression   The quotient of and 7    divided by 10    divided into 15    The ratio of to 5    split 7 ways    Dollars, per hour,     Write algebraic expressions for each phrase.   Five-eighths of  Four less than       In part (a) of Example 2.4.9, notice that \"of\" means multiplication when used with fractions. The same is true for percents. For example, \"35% of \" is written as  Write algebraic expressions for each phrase.   Six greater than  The product of 9 and       Evaluating Algebraic Expressions  Now we are ready to use algebraic expressions to describe variable situations. If we know the value of the variable, we can substitute this value into the expression and simplify the result. This process is called evaluating the algebraic expression.  If Martha puts gallons of gas in her car, she can drive miles.   How many miles can Martha drive if she buys 8 gallons of gas?

Writing Algebraic Expressions  Now it's time to write our own algebraic expressions to describe variable situations.  Choose the correct algebraic expression from the box for each situation described below.                Rashad is 6 years younger than Shelley. If Shelley is years old, how old is Rashad?  Each package of sodas contains 6 cans. If Antoine bought packages of sodas, how many cans did he buy?  Lizette and Patrick together own 6 cats. If Lizette owns cats, how many cats does Patrick own?    We subtract 6 from Shelley's age to get:  We multiply the number of packages by 6 to get:  We subtract the number of Lizette's cats from the total number of cats to get:   Choose the correct algebraic expression from the box for each situation described below.

How many batches can be made with 5 teaspoons of vanilla?   liters  miles per hour  batches   The first step in solving problems with algebra is to describe the problem in mathematical terms. This usually involves writing algebraic expressions. We can think of this process in three steps.  Steps for Writing Algebraic Expressions   Identify the unknown quantity. Remember that it must have numerical values.  Choose a variable to represent the unknown quantity.

Equations in Arithmetic   In arithmetic, an equals sign usually tells you to perform a calculation. If you were given the problem you would respond by filling in the blank: .  In this problem the equals sign is like a command to perform some mathematical task; it prompts you to give an answer.  An equals sign can also be used to show the result of a simplification. It says: Here is a simpler form of the same expression. Here is an example of this use of the equals sign.   In algebra, we often use the equals sign in a completely different way, to show a relationship between two algebraic expressions. When we write we are describing the relationship between Delbert's age and Francine's age. Such a statement is called an equation .  Definition  An equation is a mathematical statement that two algebraic expressions are equal.  We can use variables to write equations. For example, where and stand for Delbert's age and Francine's age. Finding relationships between variables and describing them as equations is an important algebraic skill.  During a sales event, The Home Store offers $50 off the price of any sofa. Write an equation that gives the sale price, , in terms of the regular price, .

The Solution of an Equation  An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal. An equation can be true or false. For example, the equation is true, but the equation is false.   If an equation contains a variable it can be true or false, depending on the value of the variable. The equation is true if the value of is 4, but false if has any other value.  Definition  A solution of an equation is a value of the variable that makes the equation true.  So 4 is the solution of the equation because .  Decide whether 28 is a solution of the equation .  We substitute 28 for in the equation . Multiply 6 times 28 to see if a true statement results. The statement is false, so 28 is not a solution of the equation .   Decide whether is a solution of the equation  Decide whether is a solution of the equation  Decide whether is a solution of the equation   Yes  Yes  No    Finding Solutions: Opposite Operations  To solve an equation means to find its solution (or solutions).  Some equations are easy to solve; you can see the solution just by thinking about it. For example, the equation is very easy to solve; its solution is 5.  We can solve more complicated equations by transforming them into simple ones. Of course, we must do this in a way that the new equation has the same solution as the original equation.  We will use the fact that each of the four arithmetic operations has an opposite operation .  Opposite Operations  Choose a value for and fill in the Example column.   Addition and subtraction are opposite operations.         Example   Start with any number.     Add 12 to get a new number.     Now subtract 12 from the new number.     You should get your original number back again.     You don't have to use 12 to add and subtract; any number will work.  Multiplication and division are opposite operations.         Example   Start with any number.     Multiply by 3 to get a new number.     Now divide the new number by 3.     You should get your original number back again.     Try multiplying and dividing by another number besides 3 (but not 0).   We see that subtraction \"undoes\" the effect of addition, and division \"undoes\" the effect of multiplication. Next we'll use opposite operations to solve an equation.   Isolating the Variable  Consider the equation You can check that the solution to this easy equation is 10. Even though you can solve the equation in your head, we'll use it as an example to demonstrate techniques for solving more complicated equations.  We'd like to transform the equation into the simpler equation . By undoing any operations performed on we will isolate the variable on one side of the equals sign, with the solution on the other side.  Think of an equation as a set of scales, evenly balanced, with equal weights on each side. To maintain the balance, we must add or subtract an equal amount from each side of the scale.  Solve the equation  We'll use the following steps.  Step 1: Ask yourself: What operation has been performed on ?  Step 2: We perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation. The opposite operation for subtraction is addition. We have isolated the variable on the left side of the equation. The solution is on the right side, namely, 10.   It is important to perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation! Otherwise, the two sides are no longer equal, and the \"solution\" we find will not make the original equation true.  To check that the solution is correct, we substitute our value for , namely, , into the original equation to see whether a true statement results. It is a good idea to perform the check as part of the solution process.  To solve an equation   Ask yourself: Which operation has been performed on the variable?  Perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation.  Check your solution.   Use an opposite operation to solve  In Example 2.5.9, we solved an equation by \"undoing\" a subtraction. In Activity 2.5.3, note carefully how we write down the solution step in the Examples for the other three operations.  Isolating the Variable  Read each Example, then complete the Exercise following the Example.   Solve the equation  Step 1: What operation has been performed on ?  Step 2: Perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation. The solution is .  Check: Does Yes. The solution is correct.  Solve the equation  Step 1: What operation has been performed on ?  Step 2: Perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation.  Check:  Solve the equation  Step 1: What operation has been performed on ?  Step 2: Perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation. The solution is .  Check: Does Yes. The solution is correct.  Solve the equation  Step 1: What operation has been performed on ?  Step 2: Perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation.  Check:  Solve the equation  Step 1: What operation has been performed on ?  Step 2: Perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation. The solution is .  Check: Does Yes. The solution is correct.  Solve the equation  Step 1: What operation has been performed on ?  Step 2: Perform the opposite operation on both sides of the equation.  Check:   Even if you can solve these equations in your head, you should still learn to write down the solution steps!

  "title": "Volume and Surface Area",
  "body": " Volume and Surface Area   Surface Area  Boxes and Cubes  Volume    Surface Area  This is Brandi, the St. Bernard, and this is her dog house. We are going to paint her dog house. (You get to choose the color.)   We need to know how much paint to buy, so we'll start by calculating the area we want to paint. We won't paint the roof, of course, or the doorway, so that leaves the four sides of the house: front and back, left and right.  Surface Area  Here are diagrams of the four faces of the dog house. Each grid line represents 6 inches. We'll find the area of each face.  Suggestion: Calculate the area in square feet.    Area of front face:  Hint: You might think of this face as a rectangle with a triangle on top, and a smaller rectangle cut out of the middle.  Area of back face:  Hint: Now that you know the area of the front face, what's the easiest way to find the area of the back face?   Area of left face:  Area of right face:  Hint: These two are easy, and the same!  Total area:  On average, a gallon of paint covers 350 square feet. Will you have enough paint if you buy one quart?   When we calculate the sum of the areas of the outside faces of a three-dimensional object, it is called the surface area of the object. The simplest object for finding surface area is a box. Here is one.   Find the surface area of the box shown above. The dimensions are given in meters.  The box has six faces: front and back, top and bottom, left and right. Here are the areas of the six faces.  Front: square meters  Back: same as the front  Top: square meters  Bottom: same as the top  Right: square meters  Left: same as the right  Finally, we add the areas of the six faces.  You may find it easier to visualize the six faces of the box in an \"unfolded\" diagram.   Imagine cutting the edges of the box on the red lines above and unfolding it to get a flat surface that looks like this:   If you fold up the sides along the yellow lines and close the top, you will get back the original box. (You can try this yourself by tracing the figure onto a piece of paper and cutting it out!)   Boxes and Cubes  A cube is a box whose length, width, and height are all equal. That means that all six faces are identical. Here is a cube and an unfolded version.   A wooden block in the shape of a cube measures 3 inches on each side. What is its surface area? 54 sq in  If you have never tried to draw a three-dimensional box before, follow the steps below.  Interlude: How to Draw a Box  Step 1 Draw a rectangle for the front of the box.   Step 2 Draw a second rectangle for the back of the box.   Step 3 Connect the corners from the front to the back.    Boxes Unfolded  It may be helpful to cut out copies of the diagrams and fold them up.   Which of these diagrams can be folded up into a cube?  If it makes a cube, label the squares with the faces of your cube: Front, Back, Top, Bottom, Left, Right.         Sketch the box that can be made from each diagram below, and label its dimensions. The grids represent inches.     Find the surface area of each of the boxes in Problem 2.    Volume  Remember the cube in Checkpoint 3.1.3? In that exercise we were interested in the outer surface of the cube, the six faces that can be \"unfolded\" into a flat two-dimensional surface. Now we'll switch our focus to the three-dimensional space enclosed inside a box. We'll use cubes to measure that space.  Just as we use square units, such as square inches or square meters, to measure the area of a two-dimensional region, we use cubic units to measure the volume or amount of space inside a three-dimensional object. For instance, a cubic inch is the amount of space enclosed inside a cube that measures 1 inch on each side. A cubic meter is .... well, you get the idea.   Find the volume of the box shown below. The grid lines represent centimeters.   We'd like to know how many \"blocks,\" or cubic centimeters fit inside the box. Do we have to count them all? No: first let's look at just the top layer of blocks.   Counting along the front face, there are 6 rows of 4 blocks each. So the volume of the top layer is Now, there are 3 layers of blocks, each containing 24 blocks, so the total number of blocks is The volume of the box is 72 cubic centimeters.   We don't really need the grid lines to help us calculate the volume of a box. For example, here is a picture of a box with the standard labels for its dimensions.   Let's look at a particular example. We'll figure out how many cubic inches fit inside the box below, just as we did in Example 3.1.4.   The box is 10 inches high, so there are 10 layers of cubic inch blocks. Each layer contains 20 rows of 12 blocks each. One layer contains There are 10 layers of 240 blocks, for a total of The volume of the box is 2400 cubic inches.   Draw a box, and label it with these dimensions:  length = 3 feet, width = 5 feet, height = 8 feet  Find the volume of the box.  Do you see an easy way to find the volume of a box when you know its dimensions? Describe your method.   box 3 by 5 by 8  120 cu ft  Multiply the length times the width times the height.   Volume  Look back at the unfolded boxes in Problem 2 of Activity 3.1.2. (Here are tiny pictures of them.)    Draw the folded up version of each box, and label its dimensions.  Find the volume of each box.   Do you see the difference between surface area and volume?   Surface area measures the area of the of a three-dimensional object.  Volume measures the amount of the object.   Surface area is measured in square units, and volume is measured in cubic units. For example, the surface area of the cube shown at right is 6 square inches, and its volume is 1 cubic inch.  Surface Area: 6 square inches  Volume: 1 cubic inch   You may be wondering how we can find the volume of objects with curved sides, which cannot be completely filled with cubical blocks. In later lessons we'll learn how to find the volume and surface area of familiar objects such as cylinders and spheres.   But here is a method that will work on many irregular objects, such as the pitcher shown above. Fill the object with liquid or sand. Then pour the contents into a measuring cup or a box labeled with grid lines. The volume of liquid in the measuring cup is the same as the volume that came out of the pitcher!   Vocabulary   volume  surface area  cube  cubic units    Practice 3.1  Answer the questions in Problems 1-10 with complete sentences.  What is the surface area of a three-dimensional object? What units do we use to measure surface area? The surface area is the sum of the areas of the faces. We measure surface area in square units.  Describe a method for finding the surface area of an object.  How many faces does a box have? 6  What is a cube?  What does volume measure? What units do we use for volume? Volume measures the amount of space inside the object. We use cubic units  Give another common English meaning for the word \"volume\" that is not the same as its mathematical meaning.  What is a cubic meter? A cubic meter is the amount of space inside a cube 1 meter on each side.  What is the difference between area and surface area?  Is there a cube whose volume and surface area are the same number? Yes, it is 6 units on each side.  If you know the volume of a box and the area of its base, how can you find its height?

Square size  Length of box  Width of box  Height of box  Volume of box   0.5 in       1 in       1.5 in       2 in       2.5 in       3 in        What do you notice about the volume as the size of the square cut-out increases?  What size cut-out produced the largest volume in the table?  Why can't the size of the square cut-out be more than inches?   For Problems 55-56, it will be helpful to have a set of small cubes to experiment with.  Here is a picture of four 1-inch cubes arranged face-to-face.    What is the volume of the arrangement? What is its surface area?  Sketch some other ways you can arrange four cubes face-to-face. (For example, one way is in a straight line.) What is the smallest surface area you can arrange? What is the largest?   4 cu in, 18 sq in  16 sq in, 18 sq in    How many small cubes will you need to build the next larger size cube?  How many small cubes will you need to build the next larger size cube after that?  One more time: how many small cubes to build the next cube?     "

  "body": " Exponents   A New Notation  Squares and Cubes  Products and Powers  Pythagorean Theorem    A New Notation  \"I will always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job…Because (s)he will find an easy way to do it.\"  Bill Gates  Mathematicians are lazy people. They prefer the easiest or shortest way to solve a problem. Sometimes that involves inventing a new notation. In this lesson we study a new notation called an exponent .  In Section 1.3 we learned to make a factor tree to write the prime factorization of a whole number. You might review that skill before completing the Warm-Up.  Warm-Up  Make a factor tree and write the prime factorization of each number:  16 =  32 =  64 =  Did you get tired of writing down all those 2's?  Each of the factorizations above involves a repeated multiplication. Here is a shorter way to write them.  Definition  An exponent is a number that appears above and to the right of a particular factor. It tells us how many times that factor occurs in the product.  The factor to which the exponent applies is called the base , and the product is called a power of the base.  For example, we can write 32 as .   Recall that the dot, , between the 2's is another symbol for multiplication, so means .  Similarly, we can write We say that 16 is \"the fourth power of 2\" or \"2 raised to the fourth power\" or just \"2 to the fourth.\"  Use an exponent to write \"3 to the fifth power,\" then evaluate the power.  The base is 3 and the exponent is 5. We evaluate the product of 5 factors of 3.   Do not confuse powers with products! For example, does not mean . Remember that an exponent tells us how many times the base occurs in a repeated multiplication.  Is the same as ? No!   Write each power as a repeated multiplication, then evaluate the power. (Use your calculator for part (d).)            A Quick Refresher  Recall that we can find the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length times its width. In the figures below, the grid lines represent centimeters.    We can find the volume of a box by multiplying its length times its width times its height.     Squares and Cubes  Exponents are useful in a variety of calculations. You probably recall that a square is a rectangle whose sides are equal, and a cube is a box whose edges are all equal.   Use exponents to calculate the area of a square whose side is 5 inches long.  Use exponents to calculate the volume of a cube whose edge is 5 inches long.     The area of the square is  The volume of the cube is   The exponents 2 and 3 are used frequently, so they have special names.   Instead of reading as \"5 raised to the second power,\" we say \"5 squared.\"  Instead of reading as \"5 raised to the third power,\" we say \"5 cubed.\"    A square closet has sides 6 feet long. Write a power to express the area of its floor space, then compute the area, including units.  A cubical storage container measures 4 meters on each side. Write a power to express the volume of the container, then compute the volume, including units.   sq ft  cu m   Exponents   Compute the squares of the whole numbers from 1 to 10.                             Compute the cubes of the whole numbers from 1 to 10.                             Compute all powers of 2 up to .                             Compute all powers of 3 up to .                               Products and Powers  How should we simplify the expression Should we multiply 3 times 5 and then square the result, or should we square 5 first and then multiply by 3?  Which Comes First?  Which option is correct:  Option 1  Option 2  We have defined powers so that an exponent applies only to its base, so Option 2 is the correct one.  Powers Before Products  Compute powers before multiplications or divisions.  If we really want to multiply before computing the power, we can use parentheses around the product. The parentheses tell us to simplify what's inside first. Compare the two calculations in the next Example.  Simplify.              Pythagorean Theorem  Delbert is taking a week-long tour on his trail bike. He is traveling across open country in the West, using a guide book that describes his route and suggests places to camp each night. This morning he read the following instructions in the guide book:   \"After breaking camp, ride directly west for 20 miles. You will come to a deep, narrow canyon running north and south. However, there is a dirt road that runs along the east side of the canyon, and precisely where you meet the road there is a bridge over the canyon. Cross the bridge and continue for two more miles to a county park, which is your first rest stop for the day.\"  Delbert sets out heading west, but his compass is not completely accurate. He is actually riding on a course slightly north of west. When he reaches the canyon, his odometer reads 20.5 miles instead of 20 miles, as the guide book described.  “Oh, well,” thinks Delbert, who is getting a little tired and ready for his rest stop, “That's not so far off. If I head south on this dirt road I should come to the bridge in just a short distance.”  Warm-Up   Sketch the situation described in the story. Show Delbert's camp, the canyon and the bridge, Delbert's actual route and the route he should have taken.  Without doing any calculations, guess how far Delbert must ride on the dirt road to reach the bridge.   Definition  A triangle in which one of the angles is a right angle, or 90°, is called a right triangle . The side opposite the right angle is the longest side of the triangle, and is called the hypotenuse . The other two sides of the triangle are called the legs .   Pythagorean Theorem  In this Activity we'll investigate some properties of right triangles. You will need a piece of graph paper measured in centimeters, similar to the one shown below. Use the grid and follow the steps.   First, measure carefully and cut out a strip of paper or cardboard between 12 and 24 centimeters long. (It will be easier if you choose a whole number value for the length of the strip.)  Use your strip as the hypotenuse of a right triangle on the grid, with the legs on the axes.  Record the lengths of the legs (First Leg, , and Second Leg, ) and the Hypotenuse, , in the first three columns of the table provided. (We'll get to the other columns in a minute.)  Try several different triangles, and record the lengths of the legs.   Table 1                                               Repeat the previous exercise with a hypotenuse strip of a different length, and record your data in the first three columns of the second table.  Table 2                                               The last four columns in each table are for recording some calculations. You should be able to interpret what goes in each column:  : Square the length of the first leg.  : Square the length of the second leg.  : Add the entries in the previous two columns.  : Square the length of the hypotenuse.  Compare the entries in the last two columns of each table. Do you notice any pattern? Summarize your observations as a conjecture  Conjecture:   The Activity revealed a relationship among the sides of a right triangle. If we know the lengths of any two sides of a right triangle, we can find the third side by using a formula called the Pythagorean Theorem .  Pythagorean Theorem  If the letter stands for the length of the hypotenuse, and the lengths of the two legs are denoted by and , then   In words, the Pythagorean theorem says:      Because the square of its side length gives the area of a square, we can visualize the Pythagorean theorem with areas of squares, like this:   You can check that if we add the areas of the two squares on the legs, we get the area of the square on the hypotenuse!  The Pythagorean Theorem holds ; it is not true for any other kind of triangle.  Several ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Chinese, discovered this formula, but it is named in honor of the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who gave a proof of the formula.  Pythagorean Triples  Whole numbers that fit the Pythagorean theorem are called Pythagorean triples . You can make your own Pythagorean triple by starting with any two whole numbers, which we'll call and . Fill in the table below by using the rules at the top of each column. The first row is done for you.             2  1      3  1      3  2      4  1      4  2      4  3      5  1      5  2      5  3      5  4       Which column gives the hypotenuse of the right triangle?

  "body": " Units of Measure    Length  Metric Units  Area and Volume  Liquid Measure   I have been struck again and again by how important measurement is to improving the human condition.  Bill Gates   Length  How tall are you? Most people know their height in feet and inches. The tallest person recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records is Robert Wardlow, who lived from 1918 to 1940. He was 8 feet 11 inches tall.  Units of length    The singer Rihanna is 5 feet 8 inches tall. Express Rihanna's height in inches.  Express Rihanna's height in feet.    There are 12 inches in a foot, so 5 feet is equal to and 5 feet 8 inches is equal to Rihanna is 68 inches tall.  What fraction of a foot is 8 inches? Rihanna is feet tall.   The actor Liam Neeson is 6 feet 6 inches tall.   Express his height in inches.  Express his height in feet.   78 in  6.5 ft   The English units of length evolved from early systems that used body parts as measuring devices. Length was first measured with the forearm, hand, or finger.   An inch was the length of your finger's second joint.  A foot was about the length of a forearm (or foot, if you have big feet.)  According to legend, King Henry I decreed that a yard would be the distance from the tip of his nose to the end of his thumb.    Many everyday measurements are given in inches, feet, or yards, and it is easy to convert from one unit to another. For example, to convert from feet to inches, we multiply by 12, as we did in Example 3.3.1. To convert from inches to feet, we divide by 12.  If it's not clear whether we should multiply or divide, we can use a conversion factor to help us decide. A conversion factor is just a fraction that is equal to 1. For example, are conversion factors. We choose the factor that \"cancels out\" the old units and leaves us with the units we want. Such conversion factors are also called unit fractions .  The basketball player Yao Ming is 90 inches tall. Convert 90 inches to feet.  We'll use a conversion factor. Because 1 foot = 12 inches, the two fractions are both equal to 1. We can multiply 90 inches by either fraction without changing its value. We'd like to eliminate inches and end up with feet, so we choose the second factor. Notice how the \"inches\" cancel out, leaving us with \"feet\" as the unit. And we also see that we should divide 90 by 12. Yao Ming is 7.5 feet, or 7 feet 6 inches, tall.  NBA basketball star Andrew Bynum is 7 feet tall. His stride length is approximately 1 yard. How many steps would he take to walk a mile? (Hint: 1 mile = 5280 feet. Convert feet to yards.) 1760   Metric Units  We can also measure length in the metric system , which is based on a length called a meter . One meter is a little longer than a yard. (You can review some other metric units in Section 2.1.)   In fact,   Jamaica's Usain Bolt holds the world record in the 100-meter dash, with a time of 9.58 seconds.   How far is 100 meters in yards? In feet?  What was Usain Bolt's speed, in feet per second?    To convert 100 meters to yards, we multiply the length of 1 meter by 100. And because there are 3 feet in a yard,  Usain Bolt's speed was   One mile is equal to 1760 yards. How many meters are in one mile? Approximately 1605.4 meters.  The only countries in the world that have not officially adopted the metric system of measurement are the Unites States, Liberia, and Myanmar.  In the metric system, a meter serves the same purpose as a yard. For smaller lengths, we use centimeters (cm) . There are one hundred centimeters in 1 meter. Here is a picture of a ruler marked in both centimeters and inches. Notice that each centimeter is divided into 10 smaller units called millimeters (mm) .    The label on a picture frame says it is 65 centimeters wide. How many meters is that?  What is the approximate width of the picture frame in English units?    To convert centimeters to meters, we can multiply 65 centimeters by a unit fraction. The frame is 0.65 meter wide.  0.65 meter is approximately meter, and a meter is approximately one yard, or 3 feet, in length. So meter is about 2 feet. The picture frame is about 2 feet wide.   The actress Jane Lynch is 6 feet tall. What is her approximate height in meters? In centimeters? Approximately 1.82 meters or 182 centimeters.   How does a centimeter compare to an inch? A centimeter is a little less than half an inch in length; about the width of the nail on your index finger.     What is the length of 1 foot in centimeters?  We multiply 12 inches by a unit fraction. One foot is equal in length to 30.48 centimeters.  What is the length of 1 meter in inches? 39.37 inches  For longer distances we use kilometers (km) . There are 1000 meters in one kilometer.  Metric Units of Length    As you can see in the table above, the conversion factors in the metric system are all powers of 10. This property makes the metric system easy to use, because we can convert between units simply by moving the decimal point. For example, Can you explain each of these conversions? Use unit fractions if you like, then notice how to move the decimal point.  One kilometer is about six-tenths of a mile.   What is the length of a 5K (5 kilometer) race in miles?  We can use a unit fraction, or we can simply multiply the length of 1 kilometer by 5. Or you could notice that a 10K race is about 6.2 miles and then divide by 2 to find the length of a 5K race. Either way, a 5K race is about 3.1 miles long.  The speed limit on expressways in Canada is 110 kilometers per hour. What is the speed limit in miles per hour? About 68 mph   Area and Volume  Recall that we measure area in square units and volume in cubic units. In Activity 3.3.1 we'll see how to convert between different units of area or volume.  Area and Volume   How many square feet are there in a square yard? The lines on the grid below represent feet. In the upper left corner of the grid, draw a square yard, that is, a square that measures one yard on each side.   What is the difference between \"2 square yards\" and \"a 2-yard square\"? On the grid above, draw 2 square yards that touch along one edge. Then draw a square that measures 2 yards on each side. Are they the same? How many square yards are in a 2-yard square?  Karin's living room is 18 feet long by 12 feet wide. What is its area in square feet?  Carpet is sold by the square yard. How many square yards of carpet does Karin need for her living room?  How many square inches are there in a square foot? The lines on the grid below represent inches. Draw a square that measures 1 foot on each side.   Do you see a pattern in how to convert one square unit to another? Use your discovery to calculate the number of square inches in one square yard.  Daisy would like to cover the bulletin board in her classroom with butcher paper. The bulletin board measures 99 inches long by 48 inches tall. What is the area of the bulletin board in square inches?  What is the area of the bulletin board in square feet?  What is the area of the bulletin board in square yards?  How many cubic feet are there in a cubic yard? Here is a picture of a cubic yard, with its sides marked in feet.  Now imagine a cubic foot, with its sides marked in inches. It will have 12 layers, each 1-inch thick, and each layer will be a square that is 12 inches by 12 inches. How many cubic inches are in each layer? How many cubic inches are in the whole cubic foot?  In the construction industry, building materials such as gravel or wood chips are often measured in \"yards,\" but they really mean cubic yards. At the U-Do-It store, gravel is sold in units of 0.25 (cubic) yards. Reza's driveway is 6 feet wide and 20 feet long. How many (cubic) yards of gravel should he order to cover the driveway 4 inches thick?    Liquid Measure  Liquids are measured in volume or capacity units based on the fluid ounce.   Liquid Measure     We can use unit fractions as conversion factors for liquid measure.  A soup recipe calls for 20 fluid ounces of chicken broth. How many cups is that?  We'd like to convert fluid ounces to cups, so we multiply by the appropriate unit fraction. We can reduce to or cups.  Rachel needs three pints of cranberry juice. What fraction of a gallon container is that?  To measure capacity in metric units, we use the liter (l) . One liter is about the same as one quart. Soft drinks are often sold in 2 liter bottles.    A milliliter (ml) is 11000 of one liter. It has the same volume as 1 cubic centimeter, so 1 milliliter is also called 1 cc.    The directions on a bottle of cold medicine say to take 30 cc every 6 hours. How much is that in fluid ounces?  How many tablespoons are in one dose of the cold medicine?    First we'll convert 30 cc, or 30 milliliters, to quarts. There are 32 fluid ounces in a quart, so Thirty cc is a little over 1 fluid ounce.  There are 2 tablespoons in 1 fluid ounce, and we see that 30 cc is just a little over 1 fluid ounce, so one dose of cold medicine is just over 2 tablespoons.   A large dog like Brandi, the Saint Bernard, should be given 2.5 cc of heartworm medication. How many doses are in a 1 liter bottle of the medication? 400  Unit Conversions  Fill in the blanks with the correct conversion values. (You can find all the answers in the text for this Section!)

  "body": " Circles and Spheres    Perimeter  Circumference of a Circle  Area of a Circle  A formula for the Area of a Circle  Volume of a Sphere    Perimeter  Recall that the perimeter of a region means the length of its boundary or outer edge.  Definition  The perimeter of a two-dimensional figure is the total distance around the edge of the figure.  In an earlier lesson, we learned to find the perimeter of a straight-sided figure by adding the lengths of its sides.  For example, perhaps you know a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. Because the opposite sides of the rectangle are equal in length, we can calculate its perimeter by    You can check that the perimeter of this rectangle is 50 feet:  But how can we find the perimeter of a figure with curved sides, such as a circle? Well, we can use a tape measure, or even a piece of string, but we'd like a formula that gives us the distance around the circle in terms of the size of the circle.    Circumference of a Circle  We'll begin be reviewing some terminology about circles.  Definition  The distance from the center of a circle to any point on the circle itself is called the radius of the circle.  The diameter of a circle is the length of a line segment joining two points on the circle and passing through the center.  Thus, the diameter of a circle is twice its radius .  The perimeter of a circle is called its circumference . We can say that   the circumference is the distance around the circle,  and the diameter is the distance across the circle.    It seems clear that the bigger the diameter of the circle, the bigger its circumference will be. But is there a formula for finding the circumference of a circle in terms of its diameter?  Circumference   Collect three or four circular objects, the larger the better. Here are some suggestions: a dinner plate, a clock face, a trash can lid, a lamp shade. You will also need a measuring tape.  Measure the circumference of each circular object, and enter it into the table below. Then estimate the diameter of each object as follows: hold the end of the tape measure at one point on the rim, and sweep the tape measure around the rim until you find the largest distance across the circle.       Circumference  Diameter    Object 1      Object 2      Object 3      Object 4      For each circular object, compute the ratio . You should find that the circumference is always a little more than three times the diameter.  Compute the average of the four ratios you found in Step 3.   It is a fact that the circumference of every circle is a little more than three times its diameter. More precisely, The Greek letter ( pi , read \"pie\") stands for an irrational number: We can state this result as a formula for the circumference of a circle.   Circumference  The circumference of a circle is given by where is the diameter of the circle.  An irrational number is one whose decimal expression never ends. You can read more about irrational numbers in Section 4.3.  Most scientific calculators have a key for that you can use in calculations. If your calculator does not have a key for , you can use the approximation .  Find the distance around the edge of a circular skating rink whose diameter is 50 feet.  The distance around the edge is the circumference of the circle. So we are looking for the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 50 feet. We'll apply the formula above. Using a calculator, we find that feet, or approximately 157 feet.  Find the distance around the edge of a 10 peso coin with diameter 28 millimeters.  87.96 mm  To find the circumference of circle when we know its diameter, we multiply by . How can we find the diameter of a circle if we know its circumference?  The distance around a circular pond at the arboretum is approximately 500 yards. How far is it from the edge of the pond to the gazebo at its center?   We are given the circumference of a circle and asked to find its radius. First we'll find the diameter of the circle, using the formula . We substitute the value of , yards, and solve the formula for . Use your calculator to find that is approximately 150.15 yards. Because the radius of a circle is half its diameter, we divide 150.15 by 2 to find that the radius is 79.58 yards. The distance to the gazebo from the edge of the pond is about 79.6 yards.  A tree trunk has a circumference of 2 meters. What is the radius of the trunk?  About 0.32 m   How can you find the circumference of a circle if you know its radius instead of its diameter?  Can you write a formula for the circumference of a circle in terms of its radius?    Area of a Circle  Recall that the area measures the amount of space in a region. We measure area in square units , such as square inches or square meters. It might seem strange to ask how many square units fill the inside a circle, but you can imagine painting the inside of the circle, and then asking what size rectangle we can cover with the same amount of paint.   Area of a Circle   We can estimate the area of a circle by counting the number of squares that fit inside.    On the circle on the left, put a dot in each square that is completely within the circle. Count the number of squares with dots.  The area of the circle is larger than square units.  The circle on the right is enclosed in a square. What is the area of that square?  The area of the circle is smaller than square units.   If we make the squares smaller, we can get a better estimate for the area of the circle. Repeat parts (a) and (b) from Step 1.    On the circle on the left, put a dot in each square that is completely within the circle. Count the number of squares with dots.  The area of the circle is larger than square units.  The circle on the right is enclosed in a square. What is the area of that square?  The area of the circle is smaller than square units.   Of course, we have to take into account that the squares in Step 2 are smaller than the squares in Step 1: four Step 2 squares make one Step 2 square. So we need to divide each of our Step 2 answers by 4.  The area of the circle is between and square units.   We can continue improving our estimate of the area inside the circle by using smaller and smaller squares, but wouldn't it be nice to have a formula we could use to calculate the area in terms of the circle's radius?   A Formula for the Area of a Circle  In Activity 3.4.2, we broke up the area of the circle into small squares. To find our formula for the area, we will break up the circle into small wedges. Before we start, review your answer to Question 3 after Checkpoint 3.4.5:  Write a formula for the circumference of a circle in terms of its radius.  Circumference =  A Formula for the Area of a Circle   Here is a circle divided into 8 wedges. The radius of this circle is . Trace the circle onto a sheet of paper, then cut out all the wedges.     Arrange the wedges as shown in the lefthand picture below. Does it look sort of like a rectangle? (Or maybe a parallelogram?)   No? Okay, what if you slice off half of the first wedge and stick it on the other end, as shown in the righthand picture above?   If you are still not convinced, consider what happens when we increase the number of wedges. Look at the figure below.   Does rearranging the pieces of the circle change its area?  So if we can find the area of the almost-rectangle, it will also be the area of the circle. Your answers to (a) and (b) below will involve the radius of the circle.   What is the (vertical) width of the rectangle? Hint: Where was that line segment in the circle?  Width =  What is the (horizontal) length of the rectangle? Hint: Look at the first picture in Step 3.  Length =   Finally, use your answers to Step 4 to write a formula for the area of the rectangle -- and the circle. Your formula should be written in terms of the radius of the circle.     Here is our formula for the area of a circle.  Area of a Circle  The area enclosed by a circle is given by where is the radius of the circle.  A Quick Refresher  The number 2 in is called an exponent , and is called the base . An exponent tells us how many times the base occurs as a factor in a product. So The product is called a power of the base. We compute powers before we compute the rest of a product.    Find the area of the skating rink in Example 3.4.2 .  The diameter of the skating rink was 50 feet, so its radius is half that, or 25 feet. We substitute for in the formula for area. The area of the skating rink is approximately 1963.50 square feet.  Cara used a slab from the tree trunk in Ceckpoint 3.4.5 to make a table top. What is the area of the table top?  About 0.32 sq m   Volume of a Sphere  How much does the Earth weigh? That depends on two things: the density of the materials that make up Earth, and the volume of the planet. The volume of a three-dimensional figure measures how much space is inside the figure, and is given in cubic units .   As with the area of a circle, it may seem strange to measure the inside of a round object like a sphere in cubic units. Imagine filling the sphere with liquid, and then pouring the liquid into a rectangular box to measure its volume.  We can also find the volume of a sphere if we know its radius. The formula for the volume of a sphere is easy to use, but not so easy to justify, so in this lesson we will concentrate on how to apply the formula.  (By the way, the Earth weighs pounds.)  Volume of a Sphere  The volume of a sphere is given by where is the radius of the sphere.    In the formula for the volume of a sphere, notice that the exponent on is 3. Recall that , which we read as \" cubed,\" means .  Find the volume of a spherical water tank whose radius is 20 yards.  We substitute for in the formula for the volume of a sphere. The volume of the tank is approximately 33,510.32 cubic yards.  Find the volume of a basketball with a radius of 4.75 inches.  448.92 cu in  Here is a summary of the formulas we studied in this lesson.

The entire block (without the border) measures 30 centimeters on each side, and it is made out of 16 patches.    Find the dimensions and area of each patch.  Each patch includes a quarter of a circle, and the radius of that quarter-circle is four-fifths of the side of the patch.   Find the radius and area of one quarter-circle.  Find the area of one blue piece.   What is the total area of the blue pieces needed for one quilt block?   This quilt is called Birdhouse Row. Each birdhouse sits in a square that measures inches on a side.    Find the area of one square.  The blue roof of the birdhouse is inches wide. Find the area of one birdhouse roof.  The small patch of background color at the bottom of the birdhouse is half a square with side length inches. Find the area of this triangle.  The door to each birdhouse is a circle of diameter inches. Find the area of one door.  The rest of the front of each birdhouse is red. What is the total area of the red pieces in the quilt?   Challenge Problem  The radius of the earth is approximately 3963 miles. Suppose you have a string stretched tight around the equator of the earth.    How long is the string?  Now suppose you add 10 feet to the length of the string. How long is it now (in feet)?  Stretch out your new string so that it forms a circle a little bit bigger than the equator. What is the radius of the new circle?  How high above the surface of the earth does the new circle of string sit?

Explain how you could draw a circle using a piece of string, a pencil, and a nail.  How did we find the value of in this lesson? By dividing the circumference of a circle by its diameter.  Why do we say that is an irrational number? (If you don't remember the meaning of \"irrational number,\" look it up.)  Some people use as an approximation for . Is that value more or less than ?

Okay, what if you slice off half of the first wedge and stick it on the other end, as shown in the righthand picture above?   If you are still not convinced, consider what happens when we increase the number of wedges. Look at the figure below.   Does rearranging the pieces of the circle change its area?  So if we can find the area of the almost-rectangle, it will also be the area of the circle. Your answers to (a) and (b) below will involve the radius of the circle.   What is the (vertical) width of the rectangle? Hint: Where was that line segment in the circle?  Width =  What is the (horizontal) length of the rectangle? Hint: Look at the first picture in Step 3.

One googol is equal to 10 raised to the 100th power. That is indeed a very large number, as scientists estimate there are \"only\" about atoms in the whole universe.  Large numbers that are much smaller than one googol can still be hard to visualize. For example:  How much is one million, or 1,000,000 ?  In the figure below there are 1000 blue dots, arranged in 10 blocks of 100 dots each. Now imagine a book with 1000 pages (such as War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy), and each page contains 1000 blue dots. That book contains one million blue dots.         Thus, one million is a thousand thousands.  Let's review the names of the place values up to one million. As an example, the population of New York City in 2020 was Covering about 300 square miles of land, New York is the most densely populated city in the United States, with just over 105.7 square yards of space for each person.    In January 2023, the population of the United States was over 334,278,000. How do we read that number?  The land area of the United States is 3,806,000 square miles. What is the population density of the United States, in people per square mile?    The population of the United States was about three hundred thirty-four million, two hundrd seventy-eight thousand people.  We will divide the population by the land area of the United States. The population density is about 88 people per square mile.    Look up the population and land area of your state.  Population:  Land area:  Calculate the population density of your state.   In 2023, the population of California was 40,223,504. Its land area is 163,696 square miles.  About 246 people per square mile.   How Big Is a Billion?  Here are three ways to think about the size of one billion.   Suppose you want to count to one billion, saying one number per second.   How many minutes will it take you to count to 1000?

And after quadrillions come quintillions, sextillions, and .... We're going to need a better way to keep track of all those zeroes!   Multiplying by Powers of Ten  People who deal with information often encounter very large numbers in their work. For instance, the nearest star to our solar system is Proxima Centauri, a faint, reddish star at a distance of approximately   Economists work with figures like the national debt, which has surpassed   Calculations with such large numbers can be difficult. Most calculators have only an eight- or ten-digit display, so numbers in the trillions cannot even be entered. To get around this problem, we write numbers with a special notation that uses powers of ten .  Powers of Ten  Compute each product.             What do you notice about the products above? Can you state a shortcut for multiplying a number by a power of 10?  Short-Cut Rule:  Try your shortcut on the following products, then check by multiplying.        In Activity 3.5.2, we discovered the following fact:  Powers of Ten  To multiply a number by a power of ten, we move the decimal point to the right.  For example, you can check that   The product is three-hundred sixty-two thousand.  When we write the power of ten with an exponent, we can state the rule more precisely.  To multiply a number by a power of ten   Move the decimal point to the right the same number of places as the exponent on ten.  Write in zeros to fill any empty places at the end of the new number.   Compute each product.   Compute . The product is two billion, eight hundred million.  Compute . The product is one hundred seventy.   When you write your answer, don't forget to insert commas at the proper locations, before every third digit from the right-hand end. This partitions the number into thousands, millions, billions, and so on, and makes it easier to read.  Compute each product, then write your answer in words.      ; one hundred twenty-three thousand  ; one hundred twenty-three   The rule for multiplying by a power of ten is not . It follows from the fact that our number system is based on powers of ten: each place value is 10 times the place to its right.   Using Powers of Ten  We can also reverse the process and write numbers with powers of ten. For example, and We figure out what power of ten to use by counting backwards to the new location of the decimal.  Find the correct power of ten.       Counting backwards to the new location of the decimal, we see that we must move the decimal point 4 places.   Therefore, we need an exponent of for 10. Thus,  Counting backwards to the new location of the decimal, we see that we must move the decimal point 7 places.   We need an exponent of for 10.   Find the correct power of 10.          Scientific Notation  Which number below is larger? Perhaps you began by counting the number of digits in each number. By doing so, you are really comparing powers of 10 : are the numbers in the millions, the billions, or ... ?  Here is a way to count digits using powers of 10:  Write each number so that it begins with a factor between one and ten.  To do this, we first move the decimal points as shown:   Then we count the number of places we moved the decimal point in each number, to find the correct power of ten: Now it is easy to see that the second number is larger.  This method for writing large numbers is called scientific notation .  To write a number in scientific notation   Move the decimal point so that there is only one (non-zero) digit to the left of the decimal.  Multiply by a power of ten, where the exponent on ten is the number of places you moved the decimal.   Regular numbers are said to be in standard notation .  Write in scientific notation.   245.3  38,200,000,000    The decimal goes after the 2.  The decimal goes after the 3.   Write in scientific notation.   98,700,000,000  98.7       Using a Calculator  You can use scientific notation to enter very large numbers in your calculator. First, look for a key labeled or . To enter the number , for example, enter 2.61 as usual. Then press the key and enter just the exponent on the power of 10; for our example, we enter 8. The calculator should then display This is the way most calculators display a number in scientific notation.  Don't write down instead of ! Calculator notation is not the same as written notation.  How many insects are there on Earth? Entomologists estimate that there are 100 million insects per acre of land, and Earth's land area is 36.48 billion acres.  We will write each number in scientific notation, then multiply them together.  100 million = insects per acre  36.48 billion = acres  Their product is  ( insects per acre) ( acres) = insects  That's 3.648 quintillion insects.   Astronomers estimate that there are 200 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and 150 billion galaxies in the universe. If each galaxy contains a similar number of stars, how many stars are there in the universe?

  "body": " Adding and Subtracting Fractions    Like Fractions  Smaller Pieces  Adding Unlike Fractions  Lowest Common Denominator  Three Steps for Adding Fractions    Like Fractions  A Quick Refresher  Remember that the denominator of a fraction tells us how many pieces to divide the whole into.   So the number in the denominator tells us the size of each piece: the bigger the denominator, the smaller one piece is.   Same Size Pieces  If we want to add two fractions together, the pieces must have the same size, which means that the fractions must have the same denominator.  Suppose you cut a pie into 8 slices, and you eat one slice. Then you eat another slice. What fraction of the pie have you eaten?   You have eaten of the pie (which you might notice is the same as ). Next, your roommate comes along and eats three more pieces of pie. That is, your roommate ate of the pie. How much of the pie is gone now?  If you said , you are correct, because:   How did you get your answer?   You added to get the total number of pieces eaten, which is .  But you didn't change the size of the slice!  Each slice is of the pie, so slices is five eighths, or of the pie.   Easy as pie. You could do this addition problem easily because the pie pieces were the same size. Both fractions had the same denominator, 8.  Definition  Fractions that have the same denominator are called like fractions .  We have just seen an example of adding like fractions.   To add (or subtract) two like fractions   Add (or subtract) the numerators.  Keep the same denominator.   Add or subtract the fractions.                 Do you remember how to reduce your answers to Checkpoint 4.1.2? You can review reducing fractions in .   Smaller Pieces  We have seen that there are many ways to write the same fraction. For example,   We can use this fact to help us add fractions that don't have the same denominator.  Suppose we would like to add and .   These are not like fractions; their pieces are not the same size. But we can break into smaller pieces, because :   So we replace by to get an equivalent problem.   Now all the pieces are the same size. We have like fractions, and we can add them:   Did you notice that the answer to Example 4.1.4, namely , can be written in its simpler reduced form as ?   You have of a chocolate cake, left over from a birthday party. One serving is of a cake. How many servings do you have left?   Let's practice breaking a fraction into smaller pieces. Remember that the denominator tells us how many pieces are in a whole.  Smaller Pieces  Write each fraction with a larger denominator. Draw on the figure to show the new form of the fraction.                    Now reflect on your work:   Do you see how to find the new fraction in two steps? For example, describe how to write with a denominator of 20:   Hint: What did you multiply 3 by to get the new numerator? How did you find that multiplying factor?  In your own words, describe a two-step method for breaking a fraction into smaller pieces.   In Activity 4.1.1, we practiced writing an equivalent fraction with a larger denominator. The new fraction is the same portion of one whole as the old fraction, but it is broken into smaller pieces.  To write an equivalent fraction with a larger denominator   Divide the old denominator into the desired denominator.  Use that factor to multiply the old numerator.   Do you see why that works? For example, if we rewrite as , we have broken each piece into 2 smaller pieces, so that there are twice as many pieces altogether, and the denominator changes from 4 to 8. But the three pieces in our are also broken into 2 pieces each, so there are now 6 pieces out of 8 in our new fraction.    Adding Unlike Fractions  Now that you can break a fraction into smaller pieces, you can use that skill to add or subtract fractions that have different denominators.  Definition  Fractions that have different denominators are called unlike fractions .  Subtract:  First, we must arrange that both fractions have the same denominator. We do this by breaking one (or both) of the fractions into smaller pieces. Eighths are smaller pieces than fourths, so we will rewrite as an equivalent fraction with denominator 8.  We need to multiply the old denominator, namely 4, by , so we multiply the old numerator by also.  So . We replace by in the original problem.  Now we have like fractions, and we can finish the subtraction.   In Example 4.1.2, we multiplied the numerator and denominator of by to write the fraction with the denominator we needed, namely 8. When we rewrite a fraction, the number we multiply by is often called the building factor .    What building factor will you need to add and ?  What will the new form of the built-up fraction be?      Building Factors  Add or subtract the unlike fractions. Begin by using a building factor to write both fractions with the same denominator. Show your work.  Example             You may have noticed that for the problems in Activity 4.1.2, one of the denominators was always a multiple of the other denominator. What if that is not the case? We'll tackle that problem next.   Lowest Common Denominator  Can you find a number that 6 and 8 both divide into evenly? There are several ways to do this, but the simplest way is to list multiples of the larger number until you find one that is also a multiple of the smaller number.  Find a number that is a multiple of both 6 and 8.  We'll list several multiples of 8, the larger number.  Which of these multiples is also a multiple of 6 ? You can check that 6 divides evenly into 24 and 48, (and many more multiples if we continue the list). But for our purposes we want the smallest number that is a multiple of 6 and 8, so we can stop at 24.  A Quick Refresher  In Example 4.1.11, the number 24 is called the lowest common multiple of 6 and 8. It is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 6 and 8, or is a \"common\" multiple for them. We first encountered the lowest common multiple, or LCM, in Section 1.3.  Find the lowest common multiple for each pair of numbers. (In some cases, you may be able to do this in your head.)   4 and 6  6 and 9  9 and 12  12 and 20  9 and 15  10 and 16   12  18  36  60  45  80   Remember that we can only add or subtract fractions that have the same denominator, or \"like\" fractions. Finding the lowest common multiple for their denominators will help us to add unlike fractions.  Recall that in Example 4.1.4, we added and by first writing with a denominator of 6. (Notice that 6 is the lowest common multiple for 2 and 6.) To rewrite we used a building factor of .  Then the two fractions shared a common denominator . They became like fractions, so we could combine their numerators.  Sometimes we have to rewrite both fractions so that they share a common denominator.  Find a common denominator for the fractions and .  These are not like fractions, and 4 is not a multiple of 3. In order to rewrite them as like fractions, we have to find a new denominator that is a multiple of both 3 and 4.  You can probably see right away that the lowest common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12. We say that 12 is the lowest common denominator for the two fractions and .  Definition  The lowest common denominator for two fractions is the smallest number that both denominators divide into evenly.  The lowest common denominator for two fractions is often called their LCD . Do you see that finding the LCD for two fractions is the same as finding the lowest common multiple of their denominators?  Find the lowest common denominator ( LCD ) for each pair of fractions.    and   and   and   and   and   and                 Three Steps for Adding Fractions  We now have all the skills we need to add unlike fractions. Let's review the reasoning behind our process.  Adding Fractions   We can only add fractions whose pieces are the same size, which means that they have the same denominator.  We can rewrite any fraction equivalently with a different denominator by breaking it into smaller pieces.  We find an LCD so that we can break each fraction into pieces of the same size.  We use a building factor to rewrite a fraction with smaller pieces of the same size.   Once both fractions are written with the same denominator, we can combine their numerators to add or subtract them.  Here is our three-step strategy for adding or subtracting unlike fractions.  To add or subtract unlike fractions   Find an LCD for the fractions.  Build each fraction to the LCD .  Combine the resulting like fractions.   Add:  Step1: In Example 4.1.13, we found the LCD for and . The smallest multiple of 4 that is also a multiple of 3 is 12.  Step 2: Next, we must find a building factor for each fraction. We do this by dividing the old denominator into the LCD , 12.  For , the building factor is , so  For , the building factor is so  Step 3: Finally, we replace each fraction by its new form, and combine the numerators.   Let's see how that last example looks in pictures:   Adding a third and 3 fourths  The sum in Example 4.1.16, , is an improper fraction because its numerator is larger than its denominator. That just means that the fraction represents a number bigger than one whole. In this case, because , we can write We usually write as a mixed number , .  Write as a mixed number. (Hint: How many thirds are in one whole?)  We can also write a mixed number as an improper fraction by adding the fraction part to the whole number.  Write as an improper fraction.  We want to add , so we need to write with denominator 5. We use a building factor of 5.   By adding a fraction to a whole number, write each mixed number as an improper fraction.             Adding and Subtracting Unlike Fractions  Add or subtract the unlike fractions. Use the three steps:  Three Steps  Find an LCD for the fractions.  Build each fraction to the LCD .  Combine the resulting like fractions.    Add  Step 1: The LCD is 12.  Step 2:  Step 3:  Show your work.

Explain why your answer is correct. More slices must be smaller.  What does the numerator of a fraction tell us?  Explain why it doesn't make sense to add fractions that have different denominators. Their pieces aren't the same size.  Why do we keep the same denominator when we add or subtract like fractions?  For Problems 5-8, write three fractions that are equivalent to the given fraction.       For Problems 9-12, compare the fraction to the benchmark. Fill in the blank with \"larger than,\" \"smaller than,\" or \"the same size as.\"  is  larger than  is   is  smaller than  is    For Problems 13-20, add or subtract the fractions.

  "body": " Multiplying and Dividing Fractions    Take Part  Multiplying by a Fraction  Dividing by a Fraction  More Dividing by Fractions    Take Part  What does it mean to take of something? It means to divide the quantity by 3. For instance, to take of 12 eggs, we divide 12 by 3 and take 4 eggs.   The same is true if we take of a fraction. For example, to take of half a pie, we divide the half pie into 3 pieces.   When we divide a fraction into more pieces, we increase its denominator. Taking of half a pie increased the number of pieces by a factor of 3, so the denominator increased from 2 to 6. We could say that dividing a fraction by 3 multiplies the denominator by 3.  These examples suggest that to take of a fraction we can multiply the fraction by , like this:  To multiply two fractions together   Multiply the numerators together.  Multiply the denominators together.   Multiplying by also works to find of a dozen eggs, if we write 12 as a fraction, .  In other words, to take of something, we can by .   Of course, the same idea works if we want to take of something, or of something, or .  Multiply fractions to answer the question.   How many yards are there in of a mile? (There are 1760 yards in 1 mile.)  Josie has chocolate bars to share equally among 6 children. What fraction of a chocolate bar will each child get?  Hint: Rewrite as an improper fraction.   440      Multiplying by a Fraction  What does it mean to take of something? It means to divide the quantity into 3 equal parts, and then take 2 of them. For instance, to take of 12 eggs, we divide 12 into 3 groups of 4eggs each, and take 2 of those groups of 4 eggs, to get 8 eggs.   Mathematically, we divide 12 by 3 and then multiply the result by 2. Earlier we saw that dividing by 3, or taking of something, is the same as multiplying by . Is taking of something the same as multiplying by ? Yes! Observe:  You might notice that when we multiplied 12 by , we actually multiplied by 2 first and then divided by 3, instead of the other way around, but the answer comes out the same.  We can also multiply by to take of a fraction.  There was of a pizza left in the refrigerator last night, but somebody ate of it. How much of a whole pizza did they eat?   We want to find of , so we multiply the fractions together.  Whoever ate the pizza ate of a whole pizza. In the picture, you can see that of a pizza has 3 equal parts, each of which is of a pizza. So 2 of those equal parts are , or , of a whole pizza.  Here is another way to visualize of . First, draw a rectangle with 4 vertical slices and color 3 of them red to illustrate , like this:   Then, use horizontal lines to divide the rectangle into thirds, and color 2 of them blue to show of the rectangle:   The pieces colored both pink and blue illustrate of . Notice that they make up or of the entire rectangle.  Draw rectangles to illustrate the products.        2x4 grid with 3 boxes shaded  3x3 grid with 4 boxes shaded  4x3 grid with 2 boxes shaded  8x4 grid with 15 boxes shaded   Here is another example using multiplication.   Ronen has pounds of salmon to feed four people. How much salmon will be in each portion?  A standard portion is 6 ounces. Will Ronen's salmon provide each person a standard portion?    First, let's write pounds as a fraction: Because we are dividing pounds among 4 people, each person gets of that amount. So we multiply by . Each person gets of a pound of salmon.  We'd like to know how many ounces are in of a pound. A pound is equal to 16 ounces, so we multiply 16 by . Each person gets 6 ounces of salmon, which is a standard portion.    Miranda pays of her income in taxes, and of those taxes go to education. What fraction of Miranda's income goes to education?  Reduce your answer to part (a).        Multiplying Fractions  Use multiplication to find each fraction. Show your work.   How many cents are there in of a dollar?  The city council wants to clear of an acre of weeds to make a community garden. If 6 people volunteer, how much ground must each person clear?  You made a chocolate cake for the Math Club bake sale, but at the end of the day of the cake is left in the pan. You decide to take of the remaining cake home, and give the rest to your math teacher.   How much of the original cake are you taking home?  Illustrate your work with a rectangle.   A recipe for coffee cake calls for cups of flour and 4 eggs. You only have 3 eggs, so you decide to make of the recipe. How much flour will you need?    Dividing by a Fraction  When we divide a number, we are separating it into groups. For example, means to find how many groups of 4 fit into 12. The answer, of course, is 3; there are 3 groups of 4 in 12.   But how about dividing by a fraction? What does it mean to divide a number by ? (Notice that this is NOT the same as dividing by 3!) For example, means to find the number of thirds in 2 wholes.   There are 3 thirds in one whole, so in 2 wholes there must be thirds. We see that  Do you see that dividing by is the same as multiplying by 3? Do you see why?  Compute , and explain what it means.  The division asks how many eighths there are in wholes.   Because there are 8 eighths in one whole, there must be eighths in wholes. So  There are 28 eighths in wholes.  From the examples above, perhaps you see a method for dividing by a fraction. Try your method in the Checkpoint 4.2.11.  Compute the division, and draw a picture to illustrate. Then state in words what the division tells you.        How many thirds in 4  . There are 12 thirds in 4.  How many thirds in 4  . There are 6 fourths in .  How many sixths in 1 and 2\/3  . There are 10 sixths in .  How many eighths in 2 and half  . There are 20 eighths in .    More Dividing by Fractions  We now know what it means to divide a number by , and it turns out that dividing by is the same as multiplying by 3. What does it mean to divide a number by ? Let's consider . This division asks us how many groups of can be made out of 4 wholes.   In the picture, we see that there are 6 groups of in 4 wholes. This tells us that  But how can we calculate this result without the picture? Think about how we made the picture:   First, we separated each whole into thirds. This multiplied 4 wholes by 3, to get 12 pieces.  Then we grouped the 12 pieces into groups of 2 thirds each. This divided the 12 pieces by 2, to get 6 groups.  We started with 4, multiplied by 3, then divided by 2.   It seems that  Let's check:  We have discovered a rule for division by a fraction.  To divide a number by a fraction  Multiply the number by the reciprocal of the fraction.  Do you remember how to find the reciprocal of a fraction? We interchange the numerator and denominator. For example, the reciprocal of is , and the reciprocal of 2, or , is .  Compute  First we'll write as an improper fraction. Remember that means .  To divide by , we multiply by .  So can be broken into 10 pieces of size .   David has cans of paint. Each section of his fence needs of a can of paint. How many sections of fence can he paint before he has to buy more? 6  Dividing Fractions  For Problems 1-6,   Divide fractions.  Explain what each division means, and illustrate with rectangles.           The City Council plans to set aside acres of the city park for a community garden. Each allotment will be of an acre in size. How many allotments can they offer?    Here is one more example. It uses several of the skills we've learned.  Carrie has yards of florist's ribbon, and each bouquet uses of a yard. How many bouquets can she make?  We want to know how many pieces of length of a yard can be cut from yards, so we will divide by . First, we'll write as a fraction.  Next, we'll divide by .  Finally, is equal to , so Carrie can make bouquets. Well, actually, she can make 3 bouquets, and has left of the amount for another bouquet. That is of of a yard, or  After making 3 bouquets, she has yard left over.  Look carefully at the last part of Example 4.2.15. Remember that the division asks how many pieces of yard can be cut from yards. We got 3 whole pieces and of another piece: not of a yard, but of a piece! Here is a picture:   One-third of a piece of length yard is yard.   Vocabulary   reciprocal    Practice 4.2  Explain why multiplying a number by is the same as dividing the number by 4.

A Quick Refresher  Recall that an exponent is a number that appears above and to the right of a particular factor. It tells us how many times that factor occurs in the product. For example, You can review exponents in Section 3.2 .  To square a number means to multiply the number by itself. For example, If you know the square of a number, can you find the original number?  The area of the square shown at right is 25 square inches. What is the length of each side of the square? Because the area of a square is found by squaring the length of a side, we are looking for a number whose square is 25.  You can probably see that the number we need is 5, because . The number 5 is called a square root of 25.   Definition  A number is called a square root of if .   3 is a square root of 9 because .  8 is a square root of 64 because .  is a square root of because .   What number is a square root of 16 ? 4  If you know about negative numbers, you will have noticed that 5 is not the only square root of 25. We can see that is another square root of 25, because In fact, every positive number has two square roots, one positive and one negative. We'll learn more about negative numbers in the next lesson.  Notation  We have a special symbol called a radical sign , , to denote the positive square root of a number. For example, so       Evaluate 2  Numbers such as 16 and 25 are called perfect squares because they are the squares of whole numbers: We met perfect squares in our work with exponents. So you already know the square roots of several numbers.  Square Roots  Fill in the table below. The first two are done for you. In this table, all the numbers are perfect squares.     Number,                                    Number,                                    Approximating Square Roots  The square roots of perfect squares are easy to find. But how can we find the square roots of numbers like 3 or 5, which are not perfect squares?  You can use your calculator to find square roots, but before we do that, let's try to understand what happens.  More Square Roots  We'll try to find the square root of 5 by the method of guessing and correcting.   Because , must be bigger than 2  Because , must be smaller than 3  So is a number between 2 and 3.   Let's guess 2.5 for . To check our guess, we can square 2.5 and see if we get 5: So 2.5 is too big to be the square root of 5.   Check the squares of several other numbers between 2 and 2.5: From these values, we see that must be between 2.2 and 2.3.   Use your calculator to find the squares of several numbers between 2.2 and 2.3, until you \"capture\" 5.                   You should have discovered that is too small, and is too big. Therefore, is a number between 2.23 and 2.24.   Use your calculator to capture 5 between two squares.                   You should have discovered that is too small, and is too big. Therefore, is a number between 2.236 and 2.237.   Perhaps you think that 2.236 is close enough, and you don't want to fill in any more tables. But maybe you are curious to know how far we have to go to find the exact decimal value of .  It turns out that no matter how many decimal places we find, we will never obtain an exact decimal form for . For this reason, is called an irrational number , because it cannot be expressed as a decimal fraction.  Definition  An irrational number is one that cannot be written as a fraction.  Do you think it's strange that some numbers cannot be written as fractions? So did the Pythagoreans. Hippasus, one of Pythagoras' students, proved that is irrational, and legend has it that they threw him overboard into the ocean.   There is nothing special about . All whole numbers that are not perfect squares have square roots that are irrational. However, by increasing the number of decimal places, we can find an approximation to , or to any irrational number, as accurate as we like. For example, But there is no symbol to write the exact value of except for !  Most scientific calculators give values for square roots to as many digits as their displays allow. Look for a key labeled , and enter (On a graphing calculator, enter the radical symbol first: .) The calculator will return an approximation for , for example, 2.236068. You can then round off the number to as many decimal places as you need.  You can review rounding in .  Use a calculator to find approximate values for each square root. Round your answers to three decimal places.        Enter , and the calculator displays 1.7320508. Rounding to three decimal places gives 1.732.  Enter , and the calculator displays 15.588457. Rounding to three decimal places gives 15.588.  Enter , and the calculator displays 0.1414214. Rounding to three decimal places gives 0.141.   Use a calculator to approximate to three decimal places.   Squares and Square Roots  If you know that the square of an unknown positive number is 36, can you find the number? Let's call the unknown number . In math notation, the question becomes: can you find if you know that Of course you can: must be the square root of 36, or This is because squaring and taking square roots are opposite operations ; each operation undoes the effects of the other. If you square a number and then take the square root of the result, you get back to the original number.  If is a positive number and , what is the value of ?   must be the square root of 784, or . Using a calculator, we find that We can check our result by squaring.  In Example 4.3.9, we can also say that we solved the equation . Earlier we learned that we solve equations by applying opposite operations, and the same is true here: to solve an equation where the variable is squared, we take the square root.  If is a positive number, solve the equation .   Pythagorean Theorem  You probably remember the Pythagorean Theorem about the sides of a right triangle. Recall that a right triangle is one with a right, or ninety degree, angle. The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse , and the other two sides are the legs .  Pythagorean Theorem  If the letter stands for the length of the hypotenuse, and the lengths of the two legs are denoted by and , then   We first studied the Pythagorean Theorem in Section 3.2 . And now that we can take square roots, we can use the theorem to solve problems.  The two legs of a right triangle are 6 inches and 8 inches long. How long is the hypotenuse?   We substitute the lengths of the two legs into the Pythagorean theorem for and . The hypotenuse is 10 inches long.  The two short sides of a right triangle are 9 meters and 40 meters. What is the length of the hypotenuse? 41 meters  A triathlete wants to know the distance across a small lake, from point to point . She locates point on one side of the lake to make a right triangle as shown. The distance from to is 3 miles, and the distance from to is 4 miles. How far is it from to across the lake?   We can apply the Pythagorean theorem. Let's let represent the distance across the lake, from to . Then We square the numbers to get If 9 added to gives 16, then must be equal to 7. So must be the square root of 7. The distance across the lake is about 2.65 miles.  The Department of Roads wants to know the distance through a mountain in the path of a proposed highway from to . The field engineer locates point on a line perpendicular to the planned route. He then measures the distance from to as 2 miles, and the distance from to as 3 miles. How far is it from to through the mountain?  About 2.24 miles  Delbert's Bike Trip  In a previous lesson, we considered a problem about Delbert's bike trip.  Delbert sets out heading west, but his compass is not completely accurate. He is actually riding on a course slightly north of west. When he reaches the canyon, his odometer reads 20.5 miles instead of 20 miles, as the guide book described. How far south must Delbert ride to reach the bridge over the canyon?  Here is a picture of the situation.    Let us call the distance Delbert has to ride . The three distances, 20 miles, 20.5 miles, and miles, form a right triangle. Write an equation using the Pythagorean theorem.  Now square the two numbers in your equation to get a new equation.  What does your new equation tell you about the value of ?   Now you can find . Use a calculator to find that   Delbert must ride another miles to reach the bridge. (Do you find the answer surprising?)   Spiral of Roots  The figure at the start of this section is called the Spiral of Theodorus. Theodorus of Cyrene was a Greek mathematician who lived in the 5th century BCE. He used the spiral to prove that the square roots of the non-square numbers up to 17 are irrational.  To make the spiral, you start with the right triangle shaded in blue. Then you use the hypotenuse of that triangle as one leg of another right triangle, with a second leg of length 1. Continue the process, adding a new right triangle at each step.    Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of the first right triangle, shaded blue in the figure.  Using your answer to part 1, find the hypotenuse of the second right triangle.  Continue to find the hypotenuse of each right triangle in the figure. Do you see a pattern?   Challenge Problem  When the railroad lays a new track, they always leave a small amount of space between the ends of adjacent rails. This is because the rails expand on hot days, and without some room between rails the tracks would buckle. Suppose that a fifteen mile section of rail expands one inch, causing the track to buckle as shown in the figure. (Not to scale!)    How high will the rail rise in the middle? First, choose your best guess:   1 centimeter  2 inches  3 feet  15 yards   Now work out the answer. Be careful with units!

What is a radical sign, and what does it mean? A radical sign indicates the square root of the number inside.  What number is its own square root? Is there another such number?  For Problems 9-16, evaluate the radical. For Problems 13-16, recall that we multiply two fractions together by multiplying their numerators together and multiplying their denominators together.      7  13           11  12                              Use your calculator to make a table showing the whole numbers between 1 and 10 and their square roots.

Notice the numbers in the column on the right. Most of these are negative numbers , which tell us that the stock has decreased in value. The world of finance is just one of the areas where negative numbers are useful.  What are negative numbers? In some situations, we can think of them as opposites .  Opposites  Fill in the list below with opposites. The first two are done for you.   We can use a thermometer to visualize opposites as temperatures.   On the thermometer at right, the opposite of five degrees above zero is five degrees below zero.  Five degrees below zero is also called negative five degrees, and is written 5°.  Temperatures below 0° are represented by negative numbers. Temperatures above zero degrees are called positive .    Thermometer -5 deg   Definition  A negative number is a number less than zero. The symbol in front of a number means negative or opposite of.  Sketch thermometers that show these temperatures.         Thermometer-5 deg     Thermometer -8 deg    In part (a), the red line stops at 14 degrees above zero. In part (b), the red line stops at 8 degrees below zero.   Fill in the thermometer at right to show a temperature of .    Thermometer  Thermometer at -4   Here are some more examples of how negative numbers are used:   Elevations above sea level are given by positive numbers, and elevations below sea level are given by negative numbers.  If your checking account is overdrawn it has a negative balance.  Gains and losses in football and other sports are recorded as positive and negative numbers.  In general, positive numbers denote gains, increases, profits, and the like, and negative numbers denote losses or decreases.    Signed Numbers  When we deal with positive and negative numbers together, we call them signed numbers .  When we work with signed numbers, we use the symbol to indicate a positive number. For example, means positive 3. However, unless some special distinction is needed, we usually write positive 3 as just 3.  Use a signed number to describe each situation.   Death Valley is 273 feet below sea level. What is its elevation?  The Very Big Corporation ended 2015 with a deficit of 8 billion dollars. What is its net worth?    The elevation of Death Valley is feet.  The net worth of the Very Big Corporation is billion dollars.   Write a sentence using a signed number to describe each situation.   The water level in Pyramid Lake dropped 30 inches below normal.  Callie's checking account is overdrawn by $50.   The water level in Pyramid Lake is inches.  The balance of Callie's checking account is dollars.   We can use a bar graph to display both positive and negative numbers. Bars that extend above the zero line indicate positive values, and bars that extend below the zero line indicate negative values. (See Section 2.3 if you would like to review bar graphs.)  The bar graph below shows normal low temperatures, indegrees Celsius, for each month in Bismarck, North Dakota.    What is normally the low temperature in December?  Which month normally has the coldest temperature? What is the coldest temperature?     The bar for December extends down to , so the normal low for December is Celsius.  January has the coldest temperature, Celsius.    Look at the bar graph in Example 4.4.6. What is the normal low temperature in Bismarck in February? Is it colder in Bismarck in February or in December?  Which two months have the same negative normal low temperature? What is that temperature?   C, December  March and November, C    The Integers  In Section 2.1 we used number lines to compare decimal numbers. Now we'll extend our number lines to include negative numbers. Here is an example.   How to draw a number line   Begin by marking a position for zero in the middle of the line.  Choose a length to represent one unit, and mark off the counting numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) at equal intervals to the right of zero. These marks represent positive numbers.  Each positive number has its opposite or negative to the left of zero. For example, if we mark off three units to the left of zero, we come to the opposite of 3, or . The marks to the left of zero represent negative numbers.  The arrow at either end means that the number line continues forever.    Draw your own number line here. Mark your line from to 5. Try to make sure that your marks are equally spaced.    Definition  The positive whole numbers, the negative whole numbers, and zero make up a set of numbers called the integers .    Which of the following numbers are integers?   The numbers (which equals 5), and are integers.  List all the integers between and .  Which is colder, a temperature of or a temperature of ?  Because is colder, it makes sense to say that is less than . On the number line, lies to the left of as shown below.   Numbers increase as we move from left to right on the number line. For example, is less than , is less than 0, and 3 is less than 6. In particular, every negative number is less than every positive number.  In Section 1.4 we encountered inequality symbols to denote \"less than\" and \"greater than\".  Inequality Symbols   For example,  These two new symbols, and , are called inequality symbols, to distinguish them from the equality symbol, .  Use inequality symbols to write the following phrases.   is less than  is greater than       We can show an inequality in two ways: means the same as  Use inequality symbols to write the phrase in two different ways: is greater than . , or   Graphing on a Number Line  To show a particular number on the number line, we place a dot at its position. This is called the graph of the number. Fractions, such as or 4.8, are located between the integers on a number line.  Graph the following numbers on a number line.  We graph fractions by placing dots between the appropriate integers on the number line. For example, we graph between 5 and 6. The completed graph is shown below.   In Example 4.4.14, notice that is less than , so it is graphed to the left of , between and .  Graph the numbers , 0.2, and 1.6 on the number line below.   Number line from -3 to 3   Number line from -3 to 3 with -11\/4, 0.2, and 1.6 plotted   The opposite of a negative number is a positive number. For example, the opposite of is 6. We write the opposite of as , so Can you use a number line to explain why this makes sense?   Indicating Change with Signed Numbers  We can use negative numbers to indicate a decrease or a loss, and positive numbers to indicate an increase or a gain. For instance, if Simon lost $580 in a bad investment, we say that his financial worth changed by .  The temperature was 6° yesterday evening and changed by overnight. What was the temperature in the morning?  Start at 6° on the thermometer, as shown at right. Then count down 10° from there. This brings us to . The temperature in the morning was .   The temperature was 5° in the evening yesterday and changed by overnight. What was the temperature this morning? Illustrate your calculation on the thermometer at right.     Thermometer drops 11 deg from 5 deg   An increase or decrease is called a net change .  Simon's Systech stock was worth $15 per share yesterday, but today its value is $9 per share. What was the net change in the value of the stock?  The stock lost $6 per share in value, so the net change in its value was per share.  Corinne's condo was worth $350,000 when she bought it, but she sold it for $335,000. What was the net change in its value?  Net Change  Illustrate the change on the diagram or number line, then answer the question.    The temperature was at 6 am and changed by over the next six hours. What was the temperature at noon?   The temperature was yesterday afternoon and changed by overnight. What was the temperature this morning?     On Wednesday Brendan's checking account balance was $250. On Thursday he wrote a check for $400. What was his new balance?  On Friday Brendan deposited his paycheck of $600. What was his account balance then?   From -500 to 500     At noon the Yellow Submarine was cruising at feet (that's a depth of 80 feet below seal level.) After lunch they dove another 60 feet deeper. What was their new elevation?

  "body": " Order of Operations    Which Operations Come First  Combined Operations  Parentheses  Fraction Bars  Using a Calculator    Which Operations Come First  You would like to bake a cake. Here are the steps:  Baking a Cake   Preheat the oven  Mix the batter.  Pour the batter into the cake pan.  Put the cake pan in the oven.  Bake until done, then remove from the oven.  Frost the cake.   What if you perform those steps out of order? Your cake might not be a success! The order in which we perform a sequence of steps makes a difference to the outcome.  Algebraic expressions often involve more than one operation. Just as with cake baking, the order in which we perform those operations makes a difference to the answer. You probably know the following rule.  Rule 1  Perform additions and subtractions in order from left to right.  Simplify  We perform the operations in the order they occur, from left to right.   Simplify . Show your steps.   Combined Operations  How do we simplify the expression Should we add first, and then multiply by 4, or should we multiply first, and then add 5?        The two options give us different answers, so they cannot both be right.  You might decide to perform the operations from left to right in the order they appear, but this causes problems. (For instance, we would like and to have the same answer.)  Instead, people who use mathematics have agreed upon the following rule.  Rule 2  Perform all multiplications and divisions before additions and subtractions.  By following this rule, everyone means the same thing when they write an algebraic expression, and everyone gets the same answers. So Option 2 above is correct:  Use Rule 2 to simplify each expression.      Simplify each expression. Show your work.         We can combine these two rules into a set of guidelines.  Guidelines for Simplifying Expressions   First, perform all multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.  Next, perform all additions and subtractions in order from left to right.   Use the guidelines above to simplify each expression.       We start with multiplications and divisions, working from left to right. It is helpful to underline all the multiplication and division operations before beginning.  First, underline all the multiplication and division operations.   Simplify each expression. Show your work.          Parentheses  The guidelines we have already established are not sufficient for every situation. How can we write the following phrase in mathematical symbols?  \"Add 2 and 5, then multiply the sum by 3.\"  If you do the computations as stated, you'll see that the result is 21. But, as you can see, neither of the expressions below gives the right answer.        According to our guidelines, multiplication comes before addition. We need an override mechanism to use when we really want addition to come first. For this purpose, we use parentheses :  The parentheses are a \"grouping symbol;\" they tell us to perform any operations inside first. Thus,  Rule 3  Perform any operations inside parentheses first.  Simplify each expression.          Simplify each expression. Show your work.          Fraction Bars  A fraction bar is another kind of grouping symbol. Any operations that appear above or below a fraction bar should be completed first. For example, in the expression we compute the sum and the difference before dividing:  Rule 4  Simplify any expressions above or below a fraction bar before dividing the bottom into the top.  Simplify according to the order of operations:  We start by simplifying the denominator of the fraction.   Simplify Show your work.  We can combine all the rules in this section into a set of guidelines for simplifying expressions. These guidelines are called the order of operations .  Order of Operations   First, perform all operations inside parentheses, or above or below a fraction bar.  Next, perform all multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.  Finally, perform all additions and subtractions in order from left to right.    Using a Calculator  We can use either a fraction bar or a division symbol, to write a quotient. For example, 15 divided by 3 can be written either But the calculator does not have a fraction bar, so we must use the key for division.  Fraction Bars  If there are operations above or below the fraction bar, we must enclose those operations in parentheses.  For example, to simplify the expression  If your calculator does not have parentheses, you must perform the calculation in steps, following the order of operations: first compute to get 20, then divide 120 by 20 to get 6.  What answer would you get if you entered this keying sequence:   Use a calculator to compute  Because the calculator does not have a fraction bar, we must enclose in parentheses. We enter the expression as  The calculator returns the answer, 0.2. Can you explain why the keying sequence gives an incorrect answer?  Use a calculator to compute   Exponents and Roots  Square roots and exponents occupy the same position in the order of operations: after parentheses but before multiplications and divisions. Here is an amended set of guidelines for the order of operations.  Order of Operations   Perform any operations inside parentheses, or above or below a fraction bar, or inside a radical.  Compute all powers and roots.  Perform all multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.  Perform all additions and subtractions in order from left to right.   Simplify.          Simplify  Be careful! In Checkpoint 4.5.16, did you add 9 + 16 to get 25 before you took the square root? Look at Step 1 of the order of operations: Perform any operations ... or inside a radical. In other words,  You can also use your calculator to find approximations for expressions that involve radicals. Let's agree to round all approximate values to three decimal places, unless otherwise specified.  Simplify  The order of operations tells us how to perform the calculations in this order:   Compute  Multiply times 2  Add 5 to the result   If we enter the calculations in exactly this order, we will be sure to get the correct result. Enter:  The calculator displays the result, 10.29150262. Rounding to three places gives 10.292. However, most scientific calculators know the order of operations and will automatically perform the operations in the correct order. Test your calculator by entering  If your calculator knows the order of operations, you should get the same result as before.  Approximate to three decimal places.   Vocabulary   fraction bar  order of operations    Practice 4.5  In Problems 1-12, simplify. Use the order of operations.  5   14   5.8   6   73   24    In Problems 13-22, simplify. Notice the difference between (a) and (b) in each pair of expressions.                                                          For Problems 23-26, write each phrase as a mathematical expression.   Three times the sum of 5 and 8.  The sum of 3 times 5 and 8.       Find the sum of 18 and 30, then divide by 6.  Add to 18 the quotient of 30 divided by 6.    Subtract the difference of 12 and 8 from 25.  Subtract 8 from the difference of 25 and 12.       Find the difference of 34 and 7, then multiply by 3.  Multiply 7 times 3, then subtract the product from 34.    For Problems 27-48, simplify according to the order of operations.  27   24   54   12   23   8   13   4   52   2   7    For Problems 49-58, simplify according to the order of operations.  28   48   5   12   6    For Problems 59-68, simplify the pair of expressions.

  "body": " Working with Variables   Like Terms  Equivalent Expressions  Constant Multiples of Terms  Terms with Exponents  Multiplying Variable Expressions  Evaluating Variable Expressions    Like Terms  You know from arithmetic that you can combine quantities of the same type. For example, if you have three cats and your roommate has two cats, then together you have (3 + 2) cats, or 5 cats.  Like Terms   Suppose tuition at your college is $20 per unit. If you are enrolled in eight units this semester and plan to enroll in ten units next semester, then you can figure your tuition for the year in two ways.  Method 1: Calculate the tuition for each semester, then add them up:  Method 2: Add up the number of units for the whole year, then calculate the tuition: Either calculation gives your total tuition for the year.  Next year the tuition at your college is going up to some unknown figure, dollars per unit. If you take the same number of units next year, your tuition will be This time you cannot use Method 1 to calculate your tuition, because you don't know what is equal to.  But we can use Method 2. We add up multiples of dollars exactly the same way we added up multiples of $20. Your tuition for the year will be Now as soon as you learn the value of , you can find your tuition for the year.   In Activity 5.1.1, and are called like terms , because the variable part of each term, , is the same. (Recall that terms are expressions that are added or subtracted, and factors are expressions that are multiplied together.)  The numbers multiplied by the variable are called the coefficients of the variable. In Activity 5.1.1 the coefficients are 8 and 10.  To add or subtract like terms   Add or subtract the coefficients.  Do not change the variable part of the terms.   Add or subtract like terms.     We add or subtract the coefficients of the terms. The variable part of the terms remains the same.     Add like terms:  Because , the coefficient of is . Also, because 0 times any number is 0, we have  Combine like terms.      Combine like terms:   Equivalent Expressions  Combining like terms gives us a simpler expression that is equivalent to the original. Equivalent expressions have the same value when we substitute a number for the variable. It is always a good idea to replace complicated expressions with simpler ones if we can.  We cannot combine unlike terms. If you have three cats and your roommate has two canaries, and you try to combine them, you will still have three cats and two canaries, if you're lucky.  If the variable parts of the terms are not identical, they are not like terms, and they cannot be combined. Here are some examples of unlike terms. So, expressions such as cannot be simplified; they just stay the way they are.  A Quick Refresher  Remember the order of operations: we perform all multiplications (and divisions) before additions and subtractions. For example, to evaluate we perform the multiplication first.  Equivalent Expressions  Complete the table to help you decide whether the two expressions are equivalent.      2  5  8  10               Is equivalent to ?     2  5  8  10               Is equivalent to ?     2  5  8  10               Is equivalent to ?    Constant Multiples of Terms  Recall that means times , or because multiplication is really just repeated addition. Similarly, means times , or By combining like terms, we see that . Thus,  To multiply a term by a constant, we multiply the coefficient of the term by the constant.  The members of the Concert Choir agree that each member of the Choir should sell five tickets to the spring concert.  If one ticket sells for dollars, how much will each member make from ticket sales?  The Choir has 20 members. How much will they earn from ticket sales?    Each member of the choir will earn dollars.  The Choir will earn , or dollars.   Every staff member will carry home two sets of new regulations from the meeting. Each set of regulations weighs ounces.  How many ounces will each staff member carry home?  There are 9 staff members. What is the total weight they carry home?       Terms with Exponents  Another Quick Refresher  An exponent is a number that appears above and to the right of a particular factor. It tells us how many times that factor occurs in the product.  For example, we can write as .   In like terms the variable parts of the terms must be exactly the same, including their exponents. For example, but  This is because and are usually not the same number (unless happens to be 0 or 1), so we cannot combine them into one group (like cats and canaries).  Combine like terms.  We add the coefficients, , and leave the variable part, , unchanged.  and are not like terms, because the variable, , does not have the same exponent. So we cannot combine the terms; this expression cannot be simplified.   When combining like terms, we do not add the exponents . For example, (What is the correct answer?)  Combine like terms:   Multiplying Variable Expressions  What about multiplying variable expressions? We will need one fact from arithmetic: We can rearrange factors in any order and get the same product. Try it yourself. For example, multiply from left to right: Now rearrange the factors and multiply again. The product is the same.  Rearranging the order of factors in a product works with variables, too.  Multiply  First, we rearrange the factors to put the coefficients together and the variable factors together. Now we can multiply to get 6, and to get . Thus,  Be careful to distinguish between multiplying and adding. Remember that while For example, if ,  Multiply   Evaluating Algebraic Expressions  When we evluate an algebraic expression, we follow the order of operations.  Order of Operations   Perform any operations inside parentheses, or above or below a fraction bar, or inside a radical.  Compute all powers and roots.  Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order in which they occur from left to right.  Perform additions and subtractions in order from left to right.   (You can review the order of operations in Section 4.5.)  Evaluate the expression for .  We begin by substituting for in the expression.  Evaluate the expression for .  Hint: Simplify each factor, then multiply them together.   Vocabulary   like terms  factors  coefficient  equivalent expressions     Practice 5.1  For Problems 1-6, answer with a sentence.  Explain what like terms are. Give an example of like terms, and an example of unlike terms. Terms in which the variable parts are the same.  What is a coefficient? Give an example.  How can you test to see if two expressions are equivalent? Check to see if they both simplify to the same expression.  What does an exponent tell you about its base? Give an example.  How does rearranging the factors in a product change the result? It does not change the result.  What is the difference between factors and terms?   For Problems 7-12, decide whether the statement is true or false.  Like terms must have the same coefficient. False  To multiply a term by a constant, we multiply each factor by the constant.  The coefficient of the term is 1. True  When we add or subtract like terms, the variable parts of the terms are altered as well as the coefficients.  Terms with the same base but different exponents cannot be combined. True  Expressions with the same base but different exponents cannot be multiplied together.   For Problems 13-16, choose three values for the variable and show that the two expressions are the same for those values. (Do not choose 0 or 1.)  Many answers are possible.   Many answers are possible.    Explain the difference between and . Illustrate with a numerical example. In we multiply the variable by 2; in we multiply the variable by itself.  Explain the difference between and . Illustrate with a numerical example.    Explain the difference between and .  Evaluate both of the expressions in part (a) for   In we add terms, and in we multiply coefficients.      Explain the difference between and .  Evaluate both of the expressions in part (a) for   For Problems 21-28, add or subtract like terms.                                                       For Problems 29-34, combine like terms.         For Problems 35-40, simplify.         For Problems 41-46, simplify by combining like terms.         For Problems 47-56, simplify the expression if possible. If the expression cannot be simplified, write \"cannot be simplified.\"                    cannot be simplified              cannot be simplified              cannot be simplified              cannot be simplified          Explain the difference between and .

  "body": " Problem Solving   Using Formulas  Writing an Equation  Modeling a Problem    Using Formulas  Writing and solving equations are important skills for solving problems. Many problems can be solved using familiar formulas.  A Quick Refresher  We have solved equations by undoing the operation performed on the variable. For example, in the equation the variable is multiplied by 4, so we divide both sides of the equation by 4: The solution is 7. We can check the solution by substituting for in the equation. Because this statement is true, 7 is indeed the solution.  How long will it take Rudi to swim one mile if she can swim at a rate of 50 yards per minute?  We will use the formula . We are asked to find the time it takes Rudi to swim a mile, so will be the variable in our equation.  Rudi's swimming rate is given in yards per minute, so we must first convert the distance, one mile, into yards: one mile is equal to 1760 yards.  Next we substitute for and for into the formula. Finally, we solve the equation for . Because has been multiplied by 50, we divide both sides of the equation by 50. It takes Rudi 35.2 minutes to swim one mile. (How long is 0.2 minutes in seconds?)  To finish solving a problem, we write a sentence that answers the question in the problem.  Logicorp calculates that its costs next month will be $9100. What revenue do they need to make a profit of $1100?       Writing an Equation  Sometimes we can write an equation to solve a problem. Here is a simple example.  The sum of 17 and a number is 45. What is the number?  We choose a variable, say , to represent the unknown number. Then we write an equation about the number . Look for mathematical words to help you: \"sum\" indicates addition, and \"is\" means equals. Finally, we solve the equation. Because 17 is added to , we subtract 17 from both sides of the equation. The number is 28.  The product of 13 and a number is 598.   Write an equation that describes this problem.  Solve your equation. What is the number?     Yes, we know that you can solve these problems in your head!  But the point is not the answers to the problems, the point is to  which can help us solve much harder (and more realistic) problems once we have developed the necessary skills.   Modeling a Problem  For many problems we must write an equation by putting together the information given in the problem.  For healthy weight loss, the ratio of calories you get from carbohydrates to calories from protein should be 3 to 2. On a diet of 1500 calories per day, you should consume 450 calories of protein. How many calories of carbohydrates should you eat?  Follow the steps to write an equation.  Step 1: What are we asked to find in the problem? Choose a variable to represent it.  Step 2: Find something in the problem that we can express in two different ways.  Write an equation using the two expressions.  Step 3: Solve the equation.  Answer the question in the problem.   Observe some things about our solution:   Our equation did not start with \" \" ! The variable is part of the equation, but the equation itself is about something else, in this case, a ratio.  We did not use the 1500 calories per day in our solution. We used only the information we needed to write an equation.   We summarize our method in three steps.  Steps for Modeling a Problem   Identify the unknown quantity and choose a variable to represent it.  Find some quantity that can be expressed in two different ways, and write an equation.  Solve the equation, and answer the question in the problem.   Claudia and her alpaca Lima together weigh 173 pounds. Claudia alone weighs 94 pounds. How much does Lima weigh?  Step 1: Let stand for Lima's weight in pounds.  Step 2: Find two different expressions for the sum of Claudia's and Lima's weights, and write an equation.  Step 3: Solve your equation and answer the question.  You can probably find Lima's weight using arithmetic alone, but can you write an equation for the problem?!  Here are two things to remember about writing equations to solve problems.  Problem-Solving Hints   It is very important to specify precisely what the variable represents. You will have to write an equation about this variable, so you must have a clear idea of what it stands for.  In particular, the variable must stand for a number, so in the previous exercise, stands for \"Lima's weight,\" not for \"Lima.\"  Although the equation includes the variable, the two sides of the equation may actually be expressions for some other quantity.  In the previous Example, the variable stands for calories, but the equation gives two ways to express a ratio.   Problem Solving  Follow the three steps to solve the problems. Remember that writing an equation is more important than finding the answer!   Toshiro must reduce his daily calorie intake by 260 calories. If his goal is 1350 calories per day, what is his current calorie intake?  Step 1: What are we asked to find? Choose a variable for that quantity.  Step 2: Find two different ways to express Toshiro's dieting goal, and write an equation.  Step 3: Solve the equation and answer the question.  The ratio of calories from saturated fat to calories from polyunsaturated fat in most margarine is 0.4. A tablespoon of margarine contains 45 calories from polyunsaturated fat. How many calories from saturated fat does a tablespoon of margarine contain?  Step 1: What are we asked to find? Choose a variable for that quantity.  Step 2: Write the ratio of calories from saturated fat to calories from polyunsaturated fat in two different ways.  Step 3: Solve the equation and answer the question.  How much money must Francisco deposit in a savings account that pays 3% interest if he wants to earn $240 interest in 2 years?  Step 1: What are we asked to find? Choose a variable for that quantity.  Step 2: Find two different ways to express Francisco's interest, and write an equation.  Step 3: Solve the equation and answer the question.     Practice 5.3  For Problems 1-12,  Choose the appropriate formula and write an equation.  Solve the equation and answer the question.   The Camp for Kids Foundation hopes to make $1500 profit at its next rummage sale. If the cost of putting on the sale is $215, how much revenue will they need?    $1715   A gallon of paint will cover 350 square feet. The wooden fence around the public gardens is 7 feet high. What length of fence will one gallon of paint cover?  36% of the freshman class at Hollins College is from out-of-state. If there are 162 freshmen from out-of-state, how large is the freshman class?   450   A telephone poll of 800 voters showed 496 in favor of a school bond. What percent of those polled favored the bond?  Millie invested $1300 in a certificate of deposit for one year and earned $98.80 interest.

Equations with Two Operations  Emma can order T-shirts from a catalog for $5 each. She pays a $4 handling fee on her order.   Write an algebraic expression for the cost of ordering T-shirts.  Write an equation for the number of T-shirts Emma can order with $34.  Describe in words how to find the number of T-shirts Emma can order with $34. Your method should have two steps.  (Hint: After she pays the handling fee, how much money is left to pay for T-shirts?   In part (3) of Activity 5.4.1 you described a method for solving the equation .  Solve the equation  Just as we did with one-step equations, we try to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. We will use two steps to isolate the variable. Here is the first step.  Here is the second step.  To check the solution, we substitute into the original equation. The solution checks. Emma can order 6 T-shirts with $34.  Phoebe is stacking books on top of a footstoolthat is 30 centimeters tall . Each book is 3 centimeters thick.  Write an algebraic expression for the height of the top of a stack of books.  Write an equation for the number of books Phoebe needs for the stack to be 54 centimeters high.  Describe how to solve your equation from part (b) in two steps.     Subtract 30 from both sides, then divide both sides by 3.    A Strategy for Solving Equations  You would like to give a bracelet to a friend as a surprise gift for her birthday. First you wrap the bracelet in a small box, and then you wrap the small box in a large box. To open the gift, your friend will first unwrap the large box, and then unwrap the small box. That is, she will undo the wrappings in reverse order. We use this same idea to solve equations.  Consider the equation  What operations have been performed on the variable, ?  Imagine that you want to evaluate the expression . Following the order of operations, you would:  First multiply by 2,  then subtract 5 from the result.   To isolate the variable and solve the equation, we must undo these operations in reverse order. Whatever operation was performed last, we must undo first. So we first add 5 to both sides of the equation, and then divide both sides by 2.    Operations performed on  Steps for Solution   1. Multiplied by 2  1. Add 5   2. Subtracted 5  2. Divide by 2   Now let's use our plan to solve the equation.  Step 1  Step 2  To check the solution, we substitute for in the original equation. The solution checks.  Here is a summary of our strategy for solving equations.  To solve an equation   List the operations performed on the variable in order.  Undo those operations in reverse order.   Solve the equation  Ask yourself what operations were performed on the variable, . Then make a plan to undo those operations in reverse order.    Operations performed on  Steps for Solution   1. Divided by 3  1. Subtract 4   2. Added 4  2. Multiply by 3   Now we follow the steps in the plan.  Step 1  Step 2  The solution is 15.   Solve the equation    Operations performed on  Steps for Solution   1.  1.   2.  2.  6  With a little practice, you will be able to see the steps to \"unwrap\" the variable without writing them down. Just remember to undo the last operation first!  In the next example we use three steps to solve the equation.  Solve the equation  We analyze the order of operations performed on the variable, . Then we make a plan for undoing those operations in the reverse order.    Operations performed on  Steps for Solution   1. Multiplied by 5  1. Multiply by 6   2. Subtracted 3  2. Add 3   3.

By solving an equation, we can also convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius.  Normal body temperature for people is 98.6 F. Use the formula to convert normal temperature to degrees Celsius.  To start, we substitute for in the formula. Next, we solve the equation for . We undo the operations in three steps.    Operations performed on  Steps for Solution   1. Multiplied by 9  1.

The boiling temperature of water is 212 F. Use the formula in the prevopus Example to find the boiling temperature of water in degrees Celsius. 100 C   Problem Solving  There are many strategies for solving problems and often the most efficient approach is to write and solve an equation.  Problem Solving  Myron is buying a new computer system. He made a down payment of $500 and agreed to make 18 equal monthly payments. If the total price of the system is $6350, how much will each payment be?  In Activity 5.4.2 we consider three ways to solve this problem that do not involve algebra.  Guess a value for the amount of each payment, and check to see whether that value gives the correct total price for the computer system. For example, guess that the payment is $200. Myron would then pay  Is the total proice too high or too low? Should you try a larger value or a smaller value for your next guess at the monthly payment? Try your next guess: We would continue in this way, adjusting our guesses, until we closed in on the correct amount.  This is a more organized version of the guess-and-check method. Complete this sample table:    Monthly payment  150  200  250  300  350   Total price        Which monthly payments capture the correct total price? We could make another table with smaller increments between those monthly payments. However, this is still a tedious method for solving the problem.  Since Myron paid $500 down on the system, we can subtract 500 from the total price to find out how much he has left to pay in monthly installments. The balance will be paid in 18 equal installments, so we can divide the balance by 18 to find the amount of each installment: Each monthly payment will be $ .   Method 3 solves the problem efficiently. Notice that it uses the same technique of \"undoing\" operations that we use to solve equations. If we can describe a problem by an equation, we can work backwards to the solution by solving the equation.   Using Algebra to Solve Problems  A Quick Refresher    Identify the unknown quantity and choose a variable to represent it.  Find some quantity that can be expressed in two different ways, and write an equation.  Solve the equation, and answer the question in the problem.   Here is a solution to the problem in Activity 5.4.2 that uses an equation.  Step 1: What are we asked to find in the problem? Choose a variable to represent it.  The amount of each monthly payment:  Step 2: We can express the total price of the system in two different ways.  First way: The total price of the system is $6350.  Second way: The total price is the sum of the down payment and all the monthly payments, .  Next, we write an equation using our two expressions.  Now we solve the equation.  The solutions is 325. Myron's monthly payments will be $325.  Notice that the two steps we used to solve the equation in Example 5.4.10 (subtract 500 and divide by 18) are the same steps we used in Method 3 of Activity 5.4.2, the arithmetic solution.  Lloyd scored only 13 out of 20 on his last quiz. That was 5 points lower than his average score over the previous 6 quizzes. How many quiz points did Lloyd accumulate over 6 quizzes?  Step 1: What are we asked to find in the problem? Choose a variable to represent it.  Step 2 Express Lloyd's score on the last quiz in two different ways, and write an equation using the two expressions.  Step 3: Solve the equation and answer the question in the problem. 108 points  Problem Solving  Here are two more problems to try.  On the same quiz as Lloyd in the last Exercise 5 Lucy scored 18 out of 20, which was 2 points higher than her average over the previous 6 quizzes. How many points had Lucy accumulated over the first 6 quizzes?  Suppose that Myron's computer system from the previous Activity goes on sale for $5540 just before he buys it. If he still makes 18 monthly payments after paying $500 down, how much will each of the monthly payments be?     Practice 5.4  For Problems 1-18, solve the equation.

If the total price of the system is $6350, how much will each payment be?  In Activity 5.4.2 we consider three ways to solve this problem that do not involve algebra.  Guess a value for the amount of each payment, and check to see whether that value gives the correct total price for the computer system. For example, guess that the payment is $200. Myron would then pay  Is the total proice too high or too low? Should you try a larger value or a smaller value for your next guess at the monthly payment? Try your next guess: We would continue in this way, adjusting our guesses, until we closed in on the correct amount.  This is a more organized version of the guess-and-check method. Complete this sample table:    Monthly payment  150  200  250  300  350   Total price        Which monthly payments capture the correct total price? We could make another table with smaller increments between those monthly payments. However, this is still a tedious method for solving the problem.  Since Myron paid $500 down on the system, we can subtract 500 from the total price to find out how much he has left to pay in monthly installments. The balance will be paid in 18 equal installments, so we can divide the balance by 18 to find the amount of each installment: Each monthly payment will be $ .  "

  "body": " Graphs   Line Graphs  Plotting Points  Graphing an Equation  Reading a Graph    Line Graphs  A good way to organize and display information is to create a graph. Graphs are especially useful for illustrating the relationship between two variables.  In an earlier lesson we considered bar graphs . The height of the bar illustrated the value of the variable. However, we don't really need the whole bar to convey that information; we could instead place a dot at the top of each bar. If we connect the dots with line segments, we have created a line graph .  The bar graph in figure (a) shows the percentage of all flights from U.S. airports that experienced late departures.  Make a line graph that gives the same information.  Describe the over-all trend in late departures over the time period 1995 to 2000.      We place a dot at the top of each bar, and connect the dots with line segments, as shown above in figure (b).  The percentage of late departures increased over the five-year period. There was a spike in 1996, returning to previous levels in the following year, and then a steady increase from 1997 to 2000.   The bar graph shows the percentage of canceled flights at U.S. airports.  Make a line graph that gives the same information.  In which year was there a decline in canceled flights?      1997  We often use line graphs to illustrate trends in data over time.  The graph shows the annual fees for attending the University of California and the California State Universities from 1984 to 1994.    What was the annual fee at the University of California in 1985?  When did the annual fee at Cal State first reach $1000?  How much did the annual fee at the University of California increase from 1992 to 1993?  How much did the annual fee at Cal State increase over the same time period?    The annual fee was approximately $1300.  The annual fee at Cal State first reached $1000 in 1991.  The fee increased from about $3000 to $3700, or by about $700.  At Cal State the fee increased from $1400 to $1500, or about $100.   The bar graph shows the total annual U.S. sales of motorboats and sailboats over the decade from 1991 to 2000.    Use the grid to convert the bar graph into a line graph.  How much did annual sales increase over the decade?  In which years did annual sales decrease over the previous year?  In which year did the greatest increase in sales occur?    About 14.5 billion dollars  1992, 1998, and 1999  1995    Plotting Points  We can make a graph that shows the relationship between two variables. We first decide which variable is the input variable , and which is the output variable .  Karen was born on Peter's fourth birthday.  Make a table showing Karen's age, , and Peter's age, .  Write an equation for Peter's age in terms of Karen's age.  Make a graph showing the relationship between the variables.    Peter will always be 4 years older than Karen.    Karen's age,  0  2  5  9   Peter's age,  4  6  9  13   For this equation, is the input variable, and is the output variable. Peter's age is 4 more than Karen's age, or We start with a value of , and then we add 4 to find the value of .  On the grid, we label the horizontal direction with values of the input variable, and we label the vertical direction with values of the output variable.  For each pair of input\/output values, we place a dot, or point, on the grid. For example, the point for is labeled on the grid below left.   For each pair of input\/output values, we place a dot, or point, on the grid. For example, the point for is labeled on the grid below left.  Finally, we connect the points with a smooth curve, as shown below right. In this case, the curve is actually a straight line.    How to Plot Points   The first variable (the input variable ) tells us the location of the point in the horizontal direction.  The second variable (the output variable ) tells us its location in the vertical direction.    Plot the points given by the table.     0  10  30  50    800  700  500  300   Connect the points with a straight line. Extend your line to the edges of the grid.     Line through plotted points      Graphing an Equation  Now that we know how to plot points, we can graph an equation.  Graphing an Equation   Uncle Herb is on a diet. He can have 1200 calories per day.  If Uncle Herb has 700 calories for lunch, how many calories can he have for dinner?  Write an equation for the number of calories, , Uncle Herb can have for dinner if he consumes calories for lunch.  Fill in the table for the given values of .     200  400  600  800  1000          Plot the points from the table, and connect them with a straight line. Extend your line to the edges of the grid.   The cost of a pane of glass depends upon its area. The area of a square pane of glass is given by , where is the length of one side of the square, in feet, and is the area of the square, in square feet.  Fill in the table for the given values of .     0  1  2  3  4  5           Plot the points from the table, and connect them with a smooth curve. Extend your curve to the edges of the grid.    Look back at the graphs in Activity 5.5.1, and notice the scales on the axes. We should choose scales to fit the values of the variables.  In Problem 1, the total number of calories was 1200, so we scaled each axis by 100's from 0 to 1200.  In Problem 2, the values of went for 0 to 5, while the values of went from 0 to 25. We scaled each axis to include those values.   Steps for Graphing an Equation   Make a table of values. Choose values for the input variable and use the equation to find the values of the output variable.  Choose appropriate scales and label the axes.  Plot the points from the table, and connect them with a smooth curve.    Reading a Graph  Each point on the graph of an equation represents a pair of values for the variables that makes the equation true.  The graph shows possible values for the length and width of a rectangle with a given area.  What is the length of the rectangle if its width is 12 inches?  Complete the table.     2  4  2  6  8          Write an equation for the length of the rectangle in terms of its width.       We find the point on the graph whose -value is 12. The -value of that point is 2, so the length of the rectangle is 2 inches.   Just as we did in part (a), we find points on the graph with the given -values, then read the -value of each point on the vertical scale. Here is the completed table.     2  4  6  8    12  6  4  3   Notice that the product of and is 24 for each pair of values. Or we can say that to find , we divide 24 by . The equation for the length of the rectangle is    Refer to your graph of in Problem 2 of Activity 5.5.1.  Use the graph to answer the question: You would like a square skylight to have an area of 20 square feet. How long should the sides be?  (Hint: Find the point on the graph with . What is the value of at that point? You will have to estimate your answer.)  Now verify your answer by solving an equation. (Hint: What is the opposite operation for squaring?)   About 4.5 feet  ft   Reading a Graph  If a car brakes suddenly while traveling at a high speed, its tires will leave skid marks on the road. The velocity of the car just before braking is given in miles per hour by where is the length of the skid marks, in feet.   Complete the table of values.

  "body": " Ratios   Comparing Quantities  Ratios  Decimal Form for Ratios  Rates    Comparing Quantities  How can we compare two quantities? We might say \"Boris weighs 20 pounds more than Cyril\" or \"Product A costs $100 less than Product B.\" These statements are examples of additive comparison , although we often use subtraction to describe the relationship: But the significance of the difference between two quantities also depends on the size of the quantities themselves.   Suppose Boris and Cyril are both world-class weight lifters. Cyril weighs 250 pounds and Boris weighs 270 pounds. The 20-pound difference between their weights is not that significant.  But what if Boris and Cyril are cats? Cyril weighs 10 pounds, and Boris weighs 30 pounds. So Boris weighs three times as much as Cyril, and is a very fat cat indeed.   In part (b) of Example 6.1.1, we used multiplication to compare Boris' and Cyril's weights: Boris weighs times as much as Cyril, or We use division to make a multiplicative comparison . For the weight-lifters, Boris weighs times as much as Cyril. (We can also say that Boris weighs 8% more than Cyril.)  Use multiplicative comparison to compare prices. In which case is the $100 price difference more significant?  You are shopping for a new sweater and find one that you really like at Chic Boutique for $125. Luckily, you find the same sweater at Sweater Barn for $25.  You are shopping for a new car. The model you want costs $25,000, but you can get it in red, your favorite color, for $25,100.   5  1.004   The price difference is more significant in (a).  We can think of additive and multiplicative comparison as different ways to evaluate the relationship between two quantities. Additive comparison gives us the actual difference between two quantities. Multiplicative comparison takes into account their relative sizes.  Comparing Quantities   Jared and Carrie joined their department's \"Losing It\" contest for slimming down and getting in shape. Here are their weights before and after the six-month trial.     Before  After   Jared  210 lbs  190 lbs   Carrie  135 lbs  120 lbs    Use additive comparison to compute each person's weight loss in pounds.  Use multiplicative comparison to compute each person's weight loss as a percentage of their initial weight.  Describe what each type of comparison tells you about Jared's and Carrie's weight loss.  Which person do you think did better in the contest? Why?   You are considering two different jobs, each of which will pay you $20,000 in your first year and $21,000 in your second year.   Use additive comparison to calculate the change in your salary after one year. If Job A calculates your new salary the same way each year, how much will you make in your third year? Your fourth year? Record your answers in the table below.    Year  Job A Salary  Job B Salary   1  20,000  20,000   2     3     4     Use multiplicative comparison to calculate the percent change in your salary after one year. If Job B calculates your new salary the same way each year, how much will you make in your third year? Your fourth year? Record your answers in the table above.  Which job offers the better salary increases?     Ratios  We have looked at two ways of comparing quantities. For the rest of this lesson, we'll concentrate on multiplicative comparison.  The quotient we used for multiplicative comparison is called a ratio . It tells us how many times greater one quantity is than another. If Boris weighs times as much as Cyril, then the ratio of Boris' weight to Cyril's is 3 to 1 .  Definition  A ratio shows the relative sizes of two values by dividing one value into the other. The ratio of to is sometimes denoted by , and it is computed as the quotient .   There are 80 men in the state legislature and 16 women. To display the ratio of men to women as a quotient we would write  Just as we do with fractions, we can write the ratio in simpler form by reducing the fraction. The ratio of men to women in the state legislature is .   To say that the ratio of men to women is does NOT tell us that there are exactly 5 men and 2 women in the legislature! There could be 100 men and 40 women, or 185 men and 74 women, or many other combinations, because You can check that all of these quotients equal 2.5. There are 2.5 times as many men as women in the state legislature.  A Quick Refresher  Recall that we can use building factors to create new fractions with the same value, and we can reduce a fraction to a simpler form. The same is true for ratios. For example, we'll find three different pairs of numbers whose ratio is .  This task is the same as finding three different fractions equivalent to . Because is already in lowest terms, we will build  to find equivalent fractions. We can use any number we like (except zero) as the building factor. We have found the following pairs with the ratio 4 to 3: All these ratios are equivalent, but whenever possible we write ratios in simplest or reduced form.  On a Saturday evening a restaurant found that 84 of its customers asked for seating inside, and 35 customers preferred to sit outside on the patio.  What was the ratio of inside diners to outside diners?  Write the ratio in simplest form.   84 to 35, or  12 to 5, or    Decimal Form for Ratios  Any ratio can be expressed as a decimal fraction. For example, because , we can say that the ratio of nonsmokers to smokers in the previous Exercise is 2.4 to 1, or just 2.4. We usually express a ratio as a decimal number if the numbers being compared are decimal numbers.  Major Motors budgeted 5.6 million dollars for research next year, and 3.5 million dollars for advertising. What is the ratio of the amount budgeted for advertising to the amount budgeted for research?  The ratio of amount budgeted for advertising to amount budgeted for research is (You might also recognize this ratio as .)  During the second quarter of 2015, consumers bought 271 million Android phones and 48.1 million iPhones. What was the ratio of Android phones sold to iPhones sold? Round your answer to the nearest tenth. 5.6  Ratios in Decimal Form   In the 2015-2016 season, Kobe Bryant attempted 281 free throws and made 232 of them.

We think of fractions as comparing a part to the whole, , but a ratio may also compare one part to another part.  25% of middle school teachers are male.  What fraction of middle school teachers are male?  What is the ratio of female middle school teachers to male middle school teachers?    As a fraction, 25% is 0.25, so of middle school teachers are male.  One out of four middle school teachers are male, so three out of four are female. The ratio of female teachers to male teachers is 3 to 1, or .   40% of high school teachers are male.  What fraction of high school teachers are male?  What is the ratio of female high school teachers to male high school teachers?    3 to 2, or .   Another important use of ratios is to compare quantities that are NOT parts of a whole.  When Paolo makes coffee in the morning, he uses 3 scoops of coffee beans and 5 cups of water. Raul uses 5 scoops of coffee beans and 8 cups of water. Whose coffee is stronger?

You might hear that a certain car gets gas mileage of 28 miles per gallon, or that bananas cost 55 cents per pound. Because \"per\" indicates division, we see that and  You can think of \"per\" as meaning \"for each\" or \"for every,\" so that \"28 miles per gallon\" means that you can travel 28 miles for every gallon of gas in the tank, and \"55 cents per pound\" means that each pound costs 55 cents.   Kayla drove 130 miles in hours. Compute the ratio of the distance she traveled to the time it took.  What is the every-day interpretation of the ratio in part (a)?    The ratio of distance to time is To simplify the ratio, we divide 130 by 2.5 to find  We can interpret the simplified ratio as \"52 miles per hour.\" It gives us the average speed at which Kayla traveled. For each hour that elapsed, Kayla traveled 52 miles.   The simplified rate in Example 6.1.3 is called a unit rate because it gives us the distance Kayla traveled in one hour. We can use the unit rate to find the distance Kayla would travel (at the same rate) over other time periods. For example, in 3 hours Kayla would travel  Here is one of those tricky places where an English word can mean more than one thing in mathematics. Although a rate describes a ratio of quantities with different units, such as miles\/hours, the \"unit\" in unit rate means 1, so that the rate is simplified to the unit rate .

  "body": " Proportion   Proportional Variables  Proportional Reasoning  Using Proportions  Graphing Proportional Variables    Proportional Variables  Ratios can help us describe the relationship between two variables.  A Quick Refresher  A variable is a numerical quantity that can take on different values at different times or in different situations.  Quantities that do not change are called constants .  Proportional Variables   The table shows the price of gasoline at your local gas station on a Saturday in April. There are two variables in the table: the of gasoline purchased and the . Compute the ratios in the third column of the table.     Gallons of Gasoline  Total Price    4  $10.60    6  $15.90    8  $21.20    12  $31.80    14  $37.10     You should find that the ratio , or price per gallon, is constant. It is the same for each pair of values of the variables. This result agrees with common sense: the price per gallon of gasoline is the same no matter how many gallons you buy.  The table shows the population of a town. The variable means the age of the town, or the number of years since the town was established. , of course, means the number of people who live in the town. Compute the ratios in the third column of the table.     Years  Population    10  432    20  932    30  2013    40  4345    50  9380     The ratios in this example, , give the rate of growth of the population in people per year. You can see from the table that this ratio is not constant; in fact, it increases as time goes on.   Definition  Two variables are said to be proportional if their ratio is constant, or always the same.  In Activity 6.2.1, we see that the total price of gasoline is proportional to the number of gallons you buy. On the other hand, the population of the town is not proportional to its age.  As with the price of gasoline, sometimes it seems clear that two variables are proportional. But to check, we can identify several pairs of corresponding values for the variables, and then compute their ratios.  Tuition at Woodrow University is $30 per unit added to an enrollment fee of $100. Is the tuition proportional to the number of units you take?  To compute the tuition, we multiply the number of units by 30 and add 100 to the result. For example, if you take 6 units, your tuition is We make a table showing several pairs of variables and compute their ratios.    Number of Units  Tuition    6  280  46.67   8  340  42.50   15  550  36.67   The ratio , or tuition per unit, is not constant, so the tuition is not proportional to the number of units.  Anouk is traveling by motorhome across Alaska at 60 miles per hour. Compute the ratios in the table.    Hours  Miles    3  180    6  360    8  480     Is the distance Anouk has traveled proportional to the time she has traveled? Yes  From the Examples above, you may have discovered that two variables are proportional if one variable is a constant multiple of the other.  Is the area of a square proportional to the length of a side?  We'll make a table of values for squares of various lengths.    Length of side (in)  Area (sq in)  Ratio               From the table we see that the ratio of area to length is not constant, so the area of a square is not proportional to the length of a side.  Is the perimeter of a square proportional to the length of a side?  Hint: Make a table of values, or recall the formula for the perimeter of a square. Yes   Proportional Reasoning  Here is a simple way to look at proportional variables. If we list multiples of each variable, their ratio stays the same, and we create a ratio table . We can sometimes use a ratio table to answer questions about proportional variables.  Five boxes of crayons cost Maryellen $4.25. How much will it cost to buy one box of crayons for each of the 25 students in her class?  Because the cost of the crayons is proportional to the number of boxes, we can make a table. We add copies of 5 boxes and $4.25 until we reach 25 boxes.   We find that 25 boxes of crayons will cost $21.25.  Three acres of land can support 220 apple trees. How many apple trees can you grow on 12 acres of land? Use a ratio table to find the answer.      Acres  3      Trees  220     880  Did you notice that we can use multiplication instead of addition to solve the problems above? (After all, multiplication by a whole number is really just repeated addition.)  In the Example we can multiply 5 boxes of crayons by to get 25 boxes of crayons, so we can multiply $4.25 by to find the cost. The ratio of Boxes to Cost is not changed if we multiply both Boxes and Cost by the same number. This is the same principle that allows us to build a fraction, so we call this the build-up strategy for solving a problem about proportional variables, and we call the scale factor .  Try the build-up strategy on Exercise 6.2.6.  Walking on a treadmill at 3 miles per hour for one hour burns 219 calories. How many calories will Shayla burn if she walks for 20 minutes?  The number of calories you burn is proportional to the time you walk. Because 20 minutes is of an hour, we should multiply the number of calories by also. (We are using the build-up strategy, with a scale factor of .) In 20 minutes Shayla will burn  The relationship between proportional variables is a very simple and useful one. The ratio between the variables must stay constant. So if we multiply one variable by a scale factor, we know exactly what will happen to the other variable. If you double the amount of gasoline you buy, say from 6 gallons to 12 gallons, the price will also double. If you have 4 times the amount of land, you can plant 4 times as many apple trees.  The table shows the amount of some foreign currencies you could buy with ten US dollars on April 17, 2016. Complete the table to show how much you could buy with a US 20-dollar bill.      Currency  $10  $20   Japanese yen  1083.3    Mexican peso  177.1    Canadian dollar  13    Euro  8.9    British pound  7.1     Currency  $10  $20   Japanese yen  1083.3  2166.6   Mexican peso  177.1  354.2   Canadian dollar  13  26   Euro  8.9  17.8   British pound  7.1  14.2    Using Proportions  The build-up strategy works well if there is a nice number to multiply by. But sometimes it is easier to compute a unit rate , as we did in Section 6.1.  Six bottles of VeryBerry soda costs $10.50. How much would 10 bottles cost?  The cost of the soda is proportional to the number of bottles you buy. But 10 is not a nice multiple of 6, so instead we'll calculate the unit cost of a bottle of soda. We'll simplify the ratio by dividing top and bottom by 6. One bottle of VeryBerry Soda costs $1.75. So 10 bottles cost or $17.50.  Jayden drove 132 miles on 5 gallons of gas. How far can he drive on a full tank of 18 gallons? Use the unit rate strategy to find the answer. Start with a ratio. 475.2 miles  Using Proportions  A 6-inch turkey submarine sandwich contains 282 calories. How many calories are there in a 15-inch turkey sandwich?   We'll compare three different strategies to solve the problem.  Complete the ratio table and use it to answer the question.    Inches  3  6  12  15   Calories   282     A 15-inch turkey sandwich contains calories.  Use the build-up strategy to answer the question. First, what scale factor will you need to build 6 inches to 15 inches?  :  :  Use the unit rate strategy to answer the question.  :  :   Summary  We have used two methods to solve problems involving proportional variables:  Build-up strategy: multiply both variables by the same amount  Unit rate strategy: simplify the ratio by division   Both of these strategies come from the definition of proportional.  Earlier we saw that the build-up strategy works because we can build or reduce a fraction without changing its value. Now let us see why the unit rate strategy works.  Recall that multiplication and division are opposite operations. Every division fact can be written as a multiplication fact, and vice versa. For example, We'll use this relationship in the next Example.  How much sugar is in a 16-ounce serving of cola?  The nutrition label gives the following information.    Cola  12-ounce can  20-ounce bottle  1-liter (34 ounces)   Sugars  36 grams  60 grams  102 grams   Because the amount of sugar is proportional to the size of the serving, the ratio is constant: So is the unit rate for . And because of the relationship between multiplication and division, we see that In particular, to answer the question in the problem, We have used the unit rate strategy to see that there are 48 grams of sugar in a 16-ounce serving of cola.   Five teaspoons of sugar is equivalent to 21 grams of sugar. How many teaspoons of sugar are there in a 12-ounce can of cola?  8.57 teaspoons   Graphing Proportional Variables  The relationship between proportional variables is a simple one, and their graphs are also simple. In Section 5.5 we practiced plotting points and graphing an equation. Here is a brief review.  Quick Refresher: How to Plot Points   The first variable (the input variable ) tells us the location of the point in the horizontal direction.  The second variable (the output variable ) tells us its location in the vertical direction.   Quick Refresher: Steps for Graphing an Equation   Make a table of values. Choose values for the input variable and use the equation to find the values of the output variable.  Choose appropriate scales and label the axes.  Plot the points from the table, and connect them with a smooth curve.   Graphing Proportions  Delbert and Francine are classmates at City College. Before handing in big assignments such as term papers or lab reports, they make copies of their work. Delbert uses QuikCopy, and keeps track of the copying fee for each assignment.    Delbert's Copying Fees   Number of pages  14  27  35   Cost (cents)  112  216  280   Francine copies her assignments at Copy World.    Francine's Copying Fees   Number of pages  12  26  32   Cost (cents)  72  156  192    Verify that the cost of copying is proportional to the number of pages at both QuikCopy and at Copy World.    Delbert's Copying Fees   Number of pages  14  27  35   Cost(cents)  112  216  280   Cost\/page        Francine's Copying Fees   Number of pages  12  26  32   Cost(cents)  72  156  192   Cost\/page       How do you know that the cost of copying is proportional to the number of pages copied?  Who is paying the higher price for copying?    Plot the data for Delbert's copying fees on the grid. (Include a point for the cost of copying 0 pages.)  Connect the data points with a straight line.     Similarly, plot the data for Francine's copying fees on the same grid, and connect them with a straight line.  Which line is rising more rapidly?    From Activity 6.2.3, we observe two facts about the graphs of proportional variables.  Graphs of Proportional Variables   The graph is a straight line.  The graph passes through the point . In other words, if one variable is zero, the other variable must be zero also.   You might want to compare the graphs of copying costs in Activity 6.2.3 with the graph of tuition from Example 6.2.1, shown below. Recall that the cost of tuition was not proportional to the number of units you take, and the graph does not pass through the point .   Graph of T=100+30u    We can recover information about proportional variables from their graphs. Here is a reminder about reading points on a graph.  How to Read Points   The location of the point in the horizontal direction tells us the value of the first variable (the input variable) .  The location of the point in the vertical direction tells us the value of the second variable (the output variable) .   Kira buys granola in bulk at the health food store. There are three standard containers customers can use, as shown by the highlighted points on the graph.  What are the size and cost of each standard container?  What is the unit cost of the granola, in cents per ounce?  If we extend the graph to include 25 ounces of granola, how much taller should we make the vertical axis?     We read the ounces and cents values for each of the three points. The standard containers are 10 ounces for $3.00, 16 ounces for $4.80, and 24 ounces for $7.20.  To find the unit cost, we compute the ratio of cost to ounces.  25 ounces would cost So we would need to extend the vertical axis by another 30 units, to 750.

If we use and to stand for the variables, we can write the definition in mathematical language.  Proportional Variables, Version 1  The variables and are proportional if , where is a constant.  Notice how the algebraic equation captures the English description: \"the ratio of the values\" is , and \"is constant\" is denoted by , where is a constant.  There is nothing special about the letters and used for the variables. In the next Example we use and .  Here are some values of the two variables and . Is proportional to ?     8  20  28  52    2  5  7  13   We will check to see whether the ratio is constant.     8  20  28  52    2  5  7  13         Yes, , so is proportional to .  If two variables are proportional, we can say that is proportional to or that is proportional to . In Example 6.3.1, you can check that the ratio is also constant, in fact . It doesn't matter which ratio we compute to check for proportionality.  Is proportional to ?     2  4  6  8    8  12  16  20        No  In Example 6.3.1 above, we found that the value of was 0.25. This number is called the constant of proportionality . You can check that for each value of , we have This observation gives us another way to describe proportional variables.  Proportional Variables, Version 2  If is proportional to , then where is a constant.  Because multiplication and division are opposite operations, the two equations are two ways to say the same thing. This second version says that is proportional to if is a constant multiple of .  Recall that in algebra, we often write the product of two variables, or a number and a variable, next to each other, without any symbol between them. For example, So in particular we can write the equation for proportional variables as  The distance, , that you drive on the highway is proportional to the amount, , of gasoline that you use. Myrna used 6 gallons of gas to drive 159 miles.  Find the constant of proportionality and write an equation relating the variables.  How far can Myrna drive on a full 22-gallon tank of gas?    Because is proportional to , we can write the equation where is the constant of proportionality. We find the value of by using one pair of related values for the variables. So , and an equation relating the two variables is   If we now substitute for , we can compute the related value of . Myrna can drive 583 miles on 22 gallons of gas.   Example 6.3.4 demonstrates that the constant of proportionality, , is just the unit rate we used in Section 6.1. By simplifying the ratio for a specific pair of values, we found the distance that Myrna can drive on one gallon of gas, the unit rate for the proportion.  The number of calories, , in a bar of chocolate is proportional to its weight, . A four-ounce bar of dark chocolate contains 600 calories.   Find the constant of proportionality, and express it as a rate, using appropriate units.  Use your constant to write an equation that gives the number of calories, , in a chocolate bar in terms of its weight, .  How much chocolate can you eat for 200 calories?  How many calories are in one-half ounce of chocolate?    calories per ounce   ounces  75 calories    Steepness of the Graph  Now that we have seen how to write an equation relating proportional variables, let's take a closer look at the graphs of those equations. In Section 6.2 we made graphs for the proportional variables in the following story:  Before handing in big assignments such as term papers or lab reports, Delbert and Francine make copies of them. Delbert uses QuikCopy, and keeps track of the copying fee for each assignment. Francine copies her assignments at Copy World.    Delbert's Copying Fees   Number of pages  14  27  35   Cost (cents)  112  216  280     Francine's Copying Fees   Number of pages  12  26  32   Cost (cents)  72  156  192    We can write an equation for each of the variables, , Delbert's copying fees, and , Francine's copying fees, in terms of the number of pages copied, . We'll calculate the unit cost in each case.  Delbert's unit cost for copying is and this is the constant of proportionality, , for his equation: . Francine's unit cost for copying is so , for her equation: . We can think of the unit cost as the rate of increase in copying fees as the number of pages copied increases. Delbert's cost increases by 8 cents for each page copied. Francine's cost increases by 6 cents for each page copied. How is the rate of increase reflected in the graph?  Steepness of the Graph  The unit cost in each case is a ratio that measures the steepness of the graph. It tells us how much to increase the output variable per unit of increase in the input variable, that is, each time the input variable increases by 1.  For example, for each additional page Delbert has copied, his cost will increase by 8 cents, and the graph will climb 8 units for each unit we move to the right. And because his cost is increasing more rapidly than Francine's, the graph of Delbert's cost is steeper than the graph of Francine's cost.   Rate of Increase  In the copying fee example, we interpreted the constant of proportionality or unit rate as a rate of increase . It tells us how quickly the output variable increases with respect to the input variable, and hence how steeply the graph of the equation rises.  The notion of rate of increase can be applied to other equations besides proportions. Recall that the graph of a proportion is a straight line that passes through the point . But as long as the graph is a straight line, we can still talk about its rate of increase, even if it does not pass through the point . In Example 6.3.6 we'll compare the rate of growth of two strains of tomato plants.  Sara bought two kinds of tomato plants at the nursery. The Spring Giant seedlings were 2 inches tall, and the Jubilee seedlings were 16 inches tall. Sara recorded the height, , of the vines every two weeks, as shown in the tables below. Then she plotted their heights on a graph. Which variety grew more quickly?    Spring Giant   (wks)  (in)   0  2   2  10   4  18   6  26   8  34     Jubilee   (wks)  (in)   0  16   2  21   4  26   6  31   8  36    From the graph below, we can see that the Spring Giant tomato vines are growing faster than the Jubilee vines, because their graph increases more steeply. The steepness of the graph is a measure of how fast the vines grow.  To see exactly how fast the vines grow, we compute their rate of growth. The variables and are not proportional, so we cannot use a constant of proportionality to measure their growth.  But we can see from the table that during the first two weeks, the Spring Giant vines grew 8 inches (from 2 inches to 10 inches), so their growth rate was   Similarly, the Jubilee vines grew 5 inches (from 16 inches to 21 inches), so their growth rate was So the Spring Giant vines grew faster than the Jubilee vines, as we saw from the graph.  In Checkpoint 6.3.7, we'll compute some more growth rates. Use the tables in Example 6.3.6 about the Spring Giant and Jubilee tomato vines.  Compute the ratio to find each growth rate.    Find the growth rate of the Spring Giant tomato vines from the fourth week to the eighth week.  Find the growth rate of the Jubilee tomato vines over the first four weeks.  Find the growth rate of the Jubilee tomato vines from the fourth week to the eighth week.   4 inches\/week  2.5 inches\/week  2.5 inches\/week   Notice that the growth rate for each vine is the same over different time intervals, 4 inches\/week for the Spring Giant and 2.5 inches\/week for the Jubilee.  A Quick Refresher and Some New Notation   To calculate the increase or decrease in a quantity, we can subtract the initial value from the final value. For example, over the first 2 weeks, the Jubilee tomato vines grew from 16 inches tall to 21 inches tall, so  We use the Greek letter delta, , to stand for the change in a quantity. So, for example, stands for the change in height of the vine, and we write  In general we have    Visualizing Growth Rate on a Graph  We can illustrate the growth rate of each tomato vine on its graph.  The graph below shows the height, , of the Spring Giant tomato vine weeks after Sara planted it. The vertical line segment labeled represents the increase in the vine's height from the second week to the sixth week. The horizontal line segment labeled represents the time interval, 4 weeks.  From week 2 to week 6, the vine grew at a rate of    What does this ratio, 4 inches\/week, tell us about the graph? Place your pencil tip at any point on the graph, then move one unit to the right along the grid lines. To get back to the graph, you must now move up by four units (two grid lines on this graph). The graph increases by climbing four units vertically for each unit we move horizontally.  The graph shows the height, , of the Jubilee tomato vines weeks after Sara planted them.   Start at any point on the graph. If you move four units horizontally, how many units does the graph climb vertically? If you move one unit horizontally, how many units does the graph climb vertically?  On the graph, draw and label line segments to illustrate the growth rate of the Jubilee tomato vines from the fourth week to the eighth week. Then calculate the growth rate.   10, 2.5  2.5 inches\/week    Slope of a Line  The ratio in the Example above is called the slope of the line. The slope measures how steeply the line increases (or decreases) as we move from left to right across the graph. In general, we define the slope for any line as follows.  Slope  The slope , , of a line is the ratio as we move from any point on the line to another point on the line.  The graph shows the cost, , of renting a bicycle for hours.  Use the points and shown to calculate the slope of the line.  What does the slope tell you about renting a bicycle?     At point and , which tells us that it costs $8 to rent a bicycle for 1 hour. Point tells us that it costs $17 to rent a bicycle for 4 hours. The slope of the line is given by  The slope tells us the rate at which the cost of renting a bicycle increases. It costs $3 per hour to rent a bike.   In Example 6.3.10, note that is not proportional to ; the graph does not pass through the point . In fact, at , we have . (Perhaps there is a $5 deposit on the bike.) Nonetheless, we can compute the slope of the line by calculating the change in its variables as we move from one point to another.  Caution  Be careful when computing a slope: it is important that the numerator (top) of the slope ratio gives the vertical change as we move along the graph. This is because the slope is a unit rate; it tells us how many units the graph climbs per unit of horizontal increase. So it would be to compute for the slope in the last Example.  The graph shows the altitude (in feet) of a skier minutes after she boards a ski lift.  Use the points shown to compute the slope of the graph. Include units in your answer.   What does the slope tell you about the ski lift?    150 feet\/minute  The rate at which the ski lift rises.    Decreasing Graphs  When a variable decreases in value, we say that its change is negative. So, if the output-values of points on a line decrease as we move from left to right, we say that the slope of the line is negative.  At noon the temperature was 18 F, and it has been getting colder by 2 every hour.  Graph the temperature from noon to midnight.  Find the slope of the graph.  What does the slope tell us about the temperature?    We start by making a table that shows the temperature, , at hours after noon. For every hour that passes, we subtract 2 degrees.     0  2  5  9  12    18  14  8  0  -6   Then we plot the points from the table on a grid, as shown at right. Finally, we connect the points with a straight line.  To compute the slope of the line, we choose two points on the graph, say and . Now the the output variable, , decreases by 10 degrees (from 12 degrees to 2 degrees), so we say that . The input variable, , increases from 4 to 9, so . Next we calculate the slope ratio.  The slope is . It represents the rate at which the temperature is decreasing, 2 degrees per hour.   Softek bought a new photocopying machine for 18 thousand dollars ($18,000).

  "body": " Similarity   Similar Figures  Scale Factors  Ratio and Proportion  Conditions for Similarity  Similar Triangles     Similar Figures  When we enlarge or reduce a photograph, the image in the new photo should have the same shape as the original. An enlargement of a circle should still be a circle, and an enlargement of a square should still be a square. If the enlarged object is twice as tall as the original object, it should also be twice as wide.  The enlarged sailboat is twice as tall and twice as wide as the original.  Two figures are called similar if they have the same shape but different sizes. (They are called congruent if they have the same shape AND the same size.   Triangles are simple shapes, so we'll start our study of similar figures with some triangles. (If you would like to review some properties of triangles, you could refer to Section 1.4 .)  Which of the triangles shown below appear to be similar?   Only (a) and (e) appear to have the same shape. They could be similar. What do you notice about the angles in those two triangles?  Similar Triangles   Let's look more closely at two similar triangles. Use your protractor to measure the angles in each triangle. Record your measurements below.     You should find that the corresponding angles are equal, namely that  Now consider the sides of the two triangles. Measure the sides in centimeters and record your findings. Then compute the quotients of corresponding lengths, as shown below. What do you notice about the quotients?      Did you find that the length each side of the large triangle is 1.5 times the length of the corresponding side of the small triangle? (It is difficult to measure exactly, but your quotients should all be close to 1.5.)   In Activity 6.4.1, we learned two things about similar triangles:   The corresponding angles are equal.  We can multiply each side of the small triangle by the same factor to get the corresponding side of the large triangle. (A factor is something you multiply by.)   Could these two triangles be similar? Why or why not?  They could be similar because and , so the corresponding angles are equal.   Scale Factors  The factor of 1.5 that you found in Activity 6.4.1 is called a scale factor . If we want to enlarge a figure to a similar shape (or \"scale it up\"), we need to increase the length of each part of the figure by the same factor. Of course, we need to preserve the angles between sides as well.  The picture at right illustrates one method for enlarging a figure. The principle behind this technique is the same one that enables us to project images from a filmstrip onto a movie screen. You can try it yourself in the next Activity.   Scaling Up   Here is a picture of a sailboat. We will enlarge it by a scale factor of 2. You will need a ruler. Notice the dot in the upper left above the sailboat.  Draw a very light line from the dot to one of the vertices on the picture of the sailboat, say, the top of the mast. Measure the length of that line, and extend it in the same direction to twice its length. That's the location of the top of the mast in the enlarged figure.  Repeat step 2 with all the other vertices of the original figure. (There are 12 in all.)  Now connect them in the same order as the original to see the enlarged sail boat! (You can check that each dimension of the enlarged sailboat is twice the original.)        Ratio and Proportion  Before we continue, let's review some tools you will need.  A Quick Refresher   Look up any conversion factors you don't remember.  1 foot = inches  1 pound = ounces  1 meter = centimeters  1 quart = pints  1 hour = minutes  1 kilogram = grams   Write each decimal number as a common fraction.  0.75  0.60  0.30  0.125  1.25  2.4  3.5  2.75    The scale factor between two similar figures is also the ratio of their side lengths. In Activity 6.4.1, the ratio of the side lengths of the two triangles is 1.5. When the corresponding dimensions of two figures have the same ratio, we say that the figures are proportional .  Definition  Two figures are called proportional if the ratios of corresponding distances are equal.  Recall that we often express ratios as fractions, so, for example, we write 1.5 as , or 3 to 2. You can check that the ratios of the corresponding sides of the triangles in Activity 6.4.1 are all equal to .  Which pair of triangles is proportional?       Here are the ratios of the sides of the larger triangle to the corresponding sides of the smaller triangle: These ratios are equal (they all reduce to ), so the triangles are proportional.  Here are the ratios of the sides of the larger triangle to the corresponding sides of the smaller triangle: These ratios are not equal, so the triangles are not proportional.   A Quick Refresher  Remember that to make an equivalent fraction we must multiply or divide top and bottom by the same number. So, for example, We cannot add or subtract the same number to get an equivalent fraction. For example,   Which ratios are equivalent?  and  and  and  and   Write three ratios equivalent to the given one.      (b) and (c)        Here is what we know about using scale factors.  In similar figures, the ratios of all corresponding lengths are equal. We say that similar figures are proportional.  The scale factor is the ratio of the lengths in the new figure to the corresponding lengths in the original figure. We can write this relationship as a mathematical sentence as follows: or   The two triangles below are similar, and the lengths are in feet. Find by using a scale factor, and check your answer with ratios.   First we find the scale factor. In this case we can reduce the scale factor, dividing top and bottom by 8. To find , we multiply the corresponding side of the small triangle by the scale factor. The length, , of the vertical side of the large triangle is 12 feet.  Here are the ratios of the sides, large triangle to small triangle: You can verify that both of these ratios reduce to , the scale factor.  These two right triangles are proportional.    Find the scale factor that enlarges the small triangle to the larger one.  Find the missing sides.  Check your answers using ratios.        Conditions for Similarity  We now have enough information to formulate a test for similarity. Remember that two figures are similar if they have precisely the same shape but perhaps different sizes.  Similar Figures  Two figures are similar if, and only if  Their corresponding angles are equal, and  Their corresponding sides are proportional.   Both conditions must be true if the figures are similar.  The corresponding sides of all four parallelograms below are actually equal (so the sides are proportional), but the figures are not similar -- they don't have the same shape. You can see that their corresponding angles are not equal.   These two figures are similar. Find the missing measurements.   There are two ways to use ratios to find in Checkpoint 6.4.9.    We use the fact that corresponding sides of similar figures are proportional.  Because the ratio of the short sides is 3 to 1, the ratio of the long sides must also be 3 to 1, so must be 9.   Sometimes it is easier to look at the ratios within each figure, like this:  With these ratios, we can see that the building factor is . Again we find that must be 9.  Method 2 uses the following fact about similar figures.  Ratios in Similar Figures  In similar figures, the ratios of lengths in one figure are equal to the ratios of the corresponding lengths in the other figure.  Heather wants to know the height of a street lamp. She discovers one night that when she is 12 feet from the lamp, her shadow is 6 feet long. How tall is the lamp?  In the picture, there are two similar right triangles, which we can separate as shown below. The larger triangle has a base of feet, and the smaller triangle shows Heather and her shadow.   The ratio of height to base in the small triangle, 5 to 6, must equal the ratio of height to base in the large triangle, to 18. The building factor is 3, so must be . The lamp is 15 feet tall.  Find .  18   Similar Triangles  To finish up our study of similar figures, we'll look at the special case of similar triangles. Because they are such simple figures, the condition for similarity of triangles is actually less demanding than the conditions for similar figures in general.  If the sides of two triangles are proportional, then their corresponding angles are automatically equal, and vice versa. Thus, we only need to verify one of the conditions to show that two triangles are similar.  Similar Triangles  Two triangles are similar if either one of the following conditions is true:  Their corresponding angles are equal. OR Their corresponding sides are proportional.   Explain how you know that these two triangles are similar.   Recall that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. Both of these triangles are right triangles, so the sum of the other two angles in each triangle is 90°. So the missing angle in the first triangle must be and the missing angle in the second triangle must be 42°. Thus, the two triangles have equal angles, and therefore they are similar.  Which of these pairs are similar triangles? Explain why or why not in each case.       (c) and (d)   Vocabulary   similar  congruent  corresponding angle  corresponding side  scale factor  proportional     Practice 6-4  For Problems 1-6, answer the questions in complete sentences.  What is a factor? Something to multiply by.  How is the meaning of the word \"similar\" different in mathematics from its common English meaning?  What does it mean for two figures to be congruent? They have the same size and the same shape.  What does it mean for two figures to be proportional?  If you know the lengths of two corresponding sides in similar figures, how can you find the scale factor? Divide one by the other.  What does the 2 mean in the expression ?   For Problems 7-14, decide whether the figures are similar. If they are similar, give the scale factor from the first figure to the second figure. If the figures are not similar, explain why not.    The sides are not proportional.        For Problems 15-18, each statement is false. Correct it to make a true statement.   Two figures are similar if their sides are proportional. ... and their corresponding angles are equal.  We can create an equivalent ratio by adding the same number to both top and bottom.  Doubling the dimensions of a rectangle also doubles its area. Doubling the dimensions of a rectangle quadruples its area.  To enlarge a picture, we add the same factor to each dimension.

Yes, The third angles must also be equal.  Hakim says that if the lengths and widths of two rectangles are proportional, then the rectangles are similar. Is he correct? Explain why or why not.

If the real Titanic was 175 feet tall from the keel to the top of the funnels, how tall is the model?   0.878  153.64 ft   The Straits of Mackinac between Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsulas are 5 miles wide. Engineers studying the Mackinac bridge, the world's longest suspension bridge, build a model of the straits that is 50 feet wide.    Express the scale factor as a fraction. (There are 5280 feet in a mile.)  In their model, the suspension portion of the bridge is 7.2 feet long, and the towers are 12.5 inches above the water. What are the corresponding dimensions of the actual bridge?    For Problems 51-54,  Separate the figure into two similar triangles. Sketch and label the triangles.  Use ratios to find the unknown side.     7.5      15      "

  "body": " More About Similarity   Areas of Similar Figures  Volumes of Proportional Solids     A Quick Refresher  Two figures are similar if, and only if  Their corresponding angles are equal, and  Their corresponding sides are proportional.   The ratio of corresponding sides in similar figures is constant. But what about the ratio of the areas of the two figures? Will the ratio of the areas be the same as the ratio of the sides?   Areas of Similar Figures  The Pizza Company sells its 8-inch cheese pizza for $5.00 and its 16-inch cheese pizza for $15.00. Which is the better deal: three 8-inch pizzas for $15.00, or one 16-inch pizza for $15.00?   At first it might seem that the smaller pizzas are a better deal, since doubling the diameter of the pizza tripled its price. But with pizza, the better deal is the one that gives you the most pizza for your money, and because pizzas are flat, that means the most area.  Does doubling the diameter of a pizza double its area?  What about square pizzas? Does a 20-inch square pizza have twice the area of a 10-inch square pizza? In general, if we increase the dimensions of a figure by a particular scale factor, will its area also increase by the same factor?  Scaling Areas   What happens to the area of a square when we scale up its dimensions? We'll start with a square that measures 3 inches on each side:    What is the area of the original square?  Area =  Let's double the side of the square. Compute the area of the new square.  Area =  side = 6 inches  Now we'll compute some scale factors.  Scale factor for dimensions:  Ratio of new side to original side:  The original dimensions are scaled by a factor of   Scale factor for areas:  Ratio of new area to original area:  The original area is scaled by a factor of   How many of the original squares fit inside the new square?  What happens if we triple the original side? Compute the area of the new square.  Area = side = 9 inches  Compute scale factors again.  Scale factor for dimensions:  Ratio of new side to original side:  The original dimensions are scaled by a factor of   Scale factor for areas:  Ratio of new area to original area:  The original area is scaled by a factor of   How many of the original squares fit inside the new square?  Can you see a pattern in the results of your calculations?  Suppose the side of the new square is times the side of the original square.  Then the area of the new square will be times the area of the original square.  your answer by performing the calculations:  Side of new square:  Area of new square:  Ratio of new area to original area:   You should now have a conjecture about the areas of squares. (A conjecture is an educated guess.) Fill in the blank below.  If we scale (multiply) the sides of a square by a number , then the area of the new square is times the area of the original square.   The discovery you made in the Activity about squares is true for any similar figures.  Area Principle for Similar Figures  If we multiply each dimension of a figure by , then  The new figure is similar to the original figure, and  The area of the new figure is times the area of the original figure.   Recall that the exponent 2 in tells us to multiply together 2 copies of , so . For example,  We can use the area principle to solve problems about area.  An architect is drawing up floor plans for a new housing development. The dining room in her plan has an area of only 120 square feet. If she can increase the dimensions of the room by a factor of 1.25, what will the new area be?  The architect would like to scale the dimensions of the dining room by . According to the Area Principle, the area of the new dining room will be , or 1.5625, times the old area. The new area will then be  Alys wants to replace her old hot tub with a new circular spa. If the radius of the new spa is twice the radius of the hot tub, how much greater will the area of the spa be?  4 times greater   Volumes of Proportional Solids  Two three-dimensional objects are called proportional or similar if they have the same shape but different sizes. The properties of similar two-dimensional figures also hold for similar three-dimensional objects.  Properties of Similar Solids   The ratios of all corresponding dimensions in similar objects are equal.  The corresponding angles in similar objects are equal.  If we scale all the dimensions of a particular object by the same number, the new object will be similar to the old one.   How are the volumes of similar objects related?  Scaling Volumes  What happens to the volume of an object when we scale up its dimensions? We'll start with a box.   Compute the volume of the box with these dimensions.   length = 3 inches  width = 2 inches  height = 5 inches   Volume =  Let's double each dimension of the box and compute the volume of the new box.  length = inches  width = inches  height = inches   Volume =  Now we'll compute some scale factors.  Scale factor for dimensions:   The original dimensions are scaled by a factor of .  Scale factor for volume:   The original volume is scaled by a factor of .  How many of the original boxes fit inside the new box?   What happens if we triple the dimensions of the original box?  Compute the volume of the new box.  length = 3 inches  width = 2 inches  height = 5 inches  Volume =   Compute the scale factors again.  Scale factor for dimensions:   The original dimensions are scaled by a factor of .  Scale factor for volume:   The original volume is scaled by a factor of .  How many of the original boxes fit inside the new box?  Can you see a pattern in the results of your calculations?  Suppose the side of the new box are times the dimensions of the original box.  Then the volume of the new box will be times the volume of the original box.  your answer by performing the calculations:  Length of new box:  Width of new box:  Height of new box:  Volume of new box:  Ratio of new volume to original volume:   You should now have a conjecture about the volumes of boxes.

In Gulliver's Travels, the Lilliputians are tiny people about six inches tall. How would the volume of a Lilliputian compare to the volume of a human who is six feet tall?  The scale factor of the dimensions is the ratio of the Lilliputian's height to the human's height: Thus, the volume is scaled by The volume of a Lilliputian would be of the volume of a 6-foot tall human. (The weight of a Lilliputian would also be of the weight of a human. A 6-foot tall man weighs about 180 pounds, so a Lilliputian would weigh pounds, or ounces.)  The radius of Jupiter is about 10.7 times the radius of the Earth. How does the volume of Jupiter compare to the volume of the Earth? About 1225 times the volume of the Earth.

An orange of diameter 8 centimeters has a peel of about 200 square centimeters. How much peel would you expect an orange of diameter 10 centimeters to have? 156.25 sq cm  The Dome of the Rock is a shrine located in Jerusalem, and is the oldest surviving Islamic building.

  "title": "Adding Signed Numbers",
  "body": " Adding Signed Numbers   Adding Two Numbers with the Same Sign  Adding Two Numbers with Opposite Signs  Rules for Addition  Net Change    In Section 4.4 we looked at some of the uses of negative numbers. Some easy examples are temperature and elevation. Negative numbers are used extensively in finance and the sciences, where it is important to perform calculations with both positive and negative numbers. If you like, you can review number lines and the definition of integers in Section 4.4 .  Adding Two Numbers with the Same Sign  We'll use number lines to help us add signed numbers. You already know how to add two positive numbers; let's see how that looks on a number line.  Use a number line to illustrate the sum  Plot the first number, , as shown on the number line below. From that point, move 3 units in the positive direction , or to the right. This brings us to , so .  Illustrate the sum on the number line.   What about the sum of two negative numbers? For example, what is We'll use ideas about money to illustrate negative numbers.  Think of negative numbers as representing debts. It makes sense that the sum of two negative numbers is another negative number: if you owe $5 to one person and $3 to another person, then you are $8 in debt.  Use a number line to illustrate the sum  Plot the first number, , as shown on the number line below. From that point, move 3 units in the negative direction , or to the left. This brings us to , so .  Illustrate the sum on the number line.   From the examples above, we see that:  Adding Two Numbers with the Same Sign   The sum of two positive numbers is positive.  The sum of two negative numbers is negative.    Adding Two Numbers with Opposite Signs  Now suppose you have $6, but you owe someone $8. Your financial status is described by Your debts are greater than your assets, so you are $2 in debt.  Use a number line to illustrate the sum  Plot the first number, , as shown on the number line below. From that point, move 8 units in the negative direction , or to the left. This brings us to , so .  Illustrate the sum on the number line.   So if your debts are greater than your assets, you end up in debt. What if your assets are greater than your debts? In that case, your net worth is positive. Suppose you have $10, but you owe someone $6. We can represent this situation by the sum Once you pay off your debt, you still have $4 left.  Use a number line to illustrate the sum  Plot the first number, , as shown on the number line below. From that point, move 6 units in the negative direction , or to the left. This brings us to , so .  Do you notice that adding a negative number has the same effect as subtracting a positive number? Hold that thought; we'll see more about it shortly.  Illustrate the sum on the number line.    From the examples above, we see that the sum of a positive number and a negative number can be either positive or negative. It depends on which is \"bigger,\" (farther from zero), the positive number or the negative number.  If the positive number is farther from zero, the sum will be positive.  If the negative number is farther from zero, the sum will be negative.   In other words, if your assets outweigh your debts, your net worth is positive. If your debts outweigh your assets, your net worth is negative.  So now we know the sign of the answer when we add two numbers of opposite signs, but how do we find its actual value? Look again at the examples above. Forget about the signs for a moment. If we subtract the two numbers, we find out by how much the \"bigger\" number outweighs the smaller one. Then we use the appropriate sign, positive or negative, for the answer.  This makes sense if we consider another example about money. Suppose you earn $20, but you have a debt of $15. Your financial status is given by You need $15 of your earnings to pay off the debt, so we subtract $15 from $20. The remainder, $5, is your net worth.  Number lines give us a visual representation of signed numbers, but some people prefer a more concrete model. In Activity 7.1.1 we offer a different way to think about adding signed numbers.  Adding Two Numbers with Opposite Signs  For this Activity you will need some counters, such as chips or blocks, in two different colors. One color represents positive numbers, and the other color represents negative numbers. You can choose which is which.  Positive numbers are  Negative numbers are  We'll place counters on the table to represent sums of signed numbers.    Let's start with zero sums . Suppose you have $5 in your wallet, and you spend $5 on coffee and a cookie. What is your financial status now? When we add two numbers that are opposites, we get zero. We represent the zero sum with counters like this: (In our examples, yellow counters are positive and red ones are negative.) Because the sum is zero, we can remove them from the table. An empty table represents the number 0.  Now we'll consider a sum of two numbers with opposite signs. Represent by placing 7 positive counters and 3 negative counters on the table. You can remove the zero sum from the table. What do you have left?  You have just shown that . But here's the important part: You started with more positive counters than negative counters. You took away or subtracted 3 of the 7 positive counters to make a zero sum, and you were left with 4 positive counters.  Use your counters to find the following sums of signed numbers.        For each sum in part 3, were there more positive blocks or more negative blocks?  For each sum in part 3, was the answer positive or negative?   For each sum in part 3, how many zero pairs did you remove?       Use your counters to find the following sums of signed numbers.        For each sum in part 6, were there more positive blocks or more negative blocks?  For each sum in part 6, was the answer positive or negative?   For each sum in part 6, how many zero pairs did you remove?       Look back at your answers to Exercise 3 and Exercise 6. Do you see a way to find the sums without using counters?  How can you predict whether the sum will be positive or negative?  Now ignore the signs of the two numbers being added. To get the answers would you add those two numbers or subtract them?  Can you explain your answer to part (b) in terms of zero sums?   Explain to a classmate how to add two numbers with opposite signs.    Which model for adding signed numbers was more helpful for you, number lines or counters? Do you find that you can visualize addition without a physical model?   Rules for Addition  We summarize below what we have learned about addition.  Rules for Addition of Signed Numbers   To add two numbers with the same sign:  Add the unsigned parts of the numbers.  Use the same sign for the sum.   To add two numbers with opposite signs:  Subtract the unsigned parts of the numbers.  If the positive number is farther from zero, the sum is positive. If the negative number is farther from zero, the sum is negative.    Use the Rules for Addition to find the following sums.       Because and have the same sign, we add their unsigned parts to get We use the same sign, , for the answer. Thus,  Because and have opposite signs, we subtract their unsigned parts to get The negative number is farther from zero, so the answer is negative. Thus,  Because and have opposite signs, we subtract their unsigned parts to get The positive number is farther from zero, so the answer is positive.   Here is an informal strategy for adding signed numbers:  Step 1 Do the two numbers have the same sign or opposite signs?  Step 2a (Same sign) Great: add 'em up and keep the same sign.  Step 2b (Opposite signs) Which number is \"bigger\" (farther from zero)? That number wins -- use the sign of that number. Subtract to see how much bigger.  Use the Rules for Addition to find the following sums.          We have been using parentheses to enclose the signed numbers in a sum. The parentheses help us decide which way the symbols and are used:  to indicate a positive or negative number, or  to show addition or subtraction.   Also, it can be confusing to have two plus or minus symbols in a row.  However, we can often leave out the parentheses if it is easy to interpret the expression. For instance, the three sums in Checkpoint 7.1.12 can be written as follows.      In the next Lesson, we'll see how to simplify sums even further.   Net Change  Usually we denote gains by positive numbers and losses by negative numbers. We can find the net change in a quantity by adding those gains and losses.  Seymour's stock gained 3 points on Tuesday, but lost 7 points on Wednesday. What was the net change in the stock since Tuesday?  We use to denote a 3-point gain and to denote a 7-point loss in the price of the stock. Then The net change in Seymour's stock was a 4-point loss.  When the ballots in a disputed district were recounted, Senator Dubya lost 58 votes, but he gained 42 votes when the absentee ballots were tallied.  Write a sum of signed numbers to express the net change in the number of votes for Senator Dubya.  What was the net change in votes for Senator Dubya?    A loss of 16 votes    Vocabulary   integers  net change     Practice 7-1  For Problems 1-10, use number lines to illustrate the sums.                       Is the sum of two negative numbers positive or negative? When you are adding signed numbers, do \"two negatives make a positive\"? Negative. No.  How can you predict whether the sum of two signed numbers will be positive or negative?  Use assets and debts to explain why you should subtract the unsigned parts of the numbers when you add two numbers with opposite signs. Part of your asset cancels your debt, or vice versa; what's left is their sum.  Make up an example about money that shows how to add two negative numbers.  For Problems 15-16, without calculating, say whether the sum will be positive or negative.       positive  negative  negative         For each sum in Problem 15, describe how you would illustrate the calculation with colored counters:  How many counters of each color would you put on the table?  How many counters of each color would you remove?  How many counters of each color would be left?   8 yellow, 6 red; 6; 2 yellow  8 red, 6 red; 0; 14 red  8 red, 6 yellow; 6; 2 red   Repeat Problem 17 for the sums in Problem 16.  For Problems 19-28,  Rewrite each sum with as few parentheses as possible.  Use the Rules for Addition to compute the sums.              Use the Rules for Addition to compute the sums in Problems 29-40.               Use a calculator to compute the sums in Problems 41-50.             Use an example about money to explain why the sum of two opposites is always zero. If your debts and assets are equal, your net worth is $0.   What number can you add to to produce a sum of 0?  What number can you add to to produce a sum of 0?   For Problems 53-58,  Write a sum of signed numbers to describe the problem.  Compute the sum and answer the question in the problem.   Yariv lost 27 pounds on his diet, but then gained back 6 pounds over the holidays. What is the net change in Yariv's weight?   The net change is pounds.

  "body": "Adding Two Numbers with Opposite Signs  For this Activity you will need some counters, such as chips or blocks, in two different colors. One color represents positive numbers, and the other color represents negative numbers. You can choose which is which.  Positive numbers are  Negative numbers are  We'll place counters on the table to represent sums of signed numbers.    Let's start with zero sums . Suppose you have $5 in your wallet, and you spend $5 on coffee and a cookie. What is your financial status now? When we add two numbers that are opposites, we get zero. We represent the zero sum with counters like this: (In our examples, yellow counters are positive and red ones are negative.) Because the sum is zero, we can remove them from the table. An empty table represents the number 0.  Now we'll consider a sum of two numbers with opposite signs. Represent by placing 7 positive counters and 3 negative counters on the table. You can remove the zero sum from the table. What do you have left?  You have just shown that . But here's the important part: You started with more positive counters than negative counters. You took away or subtracted 3 of the 7 positive counters to make a zero sum, and you were left with 4 positive counters.  Use your counters to find the following sums of signed numbers.        For each sum in part 3, were there more positive blocks or more negative blocks?  For each sum in part 3, was the answer positive or negative?   For each sum in part 3, how many zero pairs did you remove?       Use your counters to find the following sums of signed numbers.        For each sum in part 6, were there more positive blocks or more negative blocks?  For each sum in part 6, was the answer positive or negative?   For each sum in part 6, how many zero pairs did you remove?       Look back at your answers to Exercise 3 and Exercise 6. Do you see a way to find the sums without using counters?  How can you predict whether the sum will be positive or negative?  Now ignore the signs of the two numbers being added. To get the answers would you add those two numbers or subtract them?  Can you explain your answer to part (b) in terms of zero sums?   Explain to a classmate how to add two numbers with opposite signs.   "

  "body": "We have been using parentheses to enclose the signed numbers in a sum. The parentheses help us decide which way the symbols and are used:  to indicate a positive or negative number, or  to show addition or subtraction.   Also, it can be confusing to have two plus or minus symbols in a row.  However, we can often leave out the parentheses if it is easy to interpret the expression. For instance, the three sums in Checkpoint 7.1.12 can be written as follows.      In the next Lesson, we'll see how to simplify sums even further. "

  "title": "Subtracting Signed Numbers",
  "body": " Subtracting Signed Numbers   Subtracting a Positive Number  Subtracting a Negative Number  Rule for Subtraction  Notation    Now that you a good intuitive grasp of addition, we'll turn our attention to subtraction. It will help if you keep two facts in mind:  subtraction is the opposite operation for addition, and  there are only two directions to move on the number line, right or left!   So, consider:  To add a positive number, we move to the right on the number line.  To subtract a positive number, we move to the left on the number line.  To add a negative number, we move to the left on the number line.  To subtract a negative number, we move to the ????? on the number line.   Let's look at some examples.  Subtracting a Positive Number  Compare the two number lines shown below. The first number line illustrates the addition problem The second number line illustrates the subtraction problem   Both number lines look the same, and both problems have the same answer, +5. On each number line, we start at +8 and move 3 units to the left. This example illustrates an important fact.  Sutracting a Positive Number  Subtracting a positive number is the same as adding the corresponding negative number. For both operations, we move to the left on the number line.  Of course, we don't need a number line to calculate simple subtractions like . But number lines may help us with less familiar problems.  Definition  Recall that the answer to an addition problem is called the sum , and the answer to a subtraction problem is called the difference .  Use number lines to illustrate the sum or difference.      We start at and move 5 units to the left.   We start at and move 5 units to the left.    Both problems have the same answer, .  Use number lines to illustrate the problems below. The answers for each pair should be the same!  and   and       Looking back at these examples, we see that we can rewrite a subtraction problem as an equivalent addition problem, then use the rules for addition.  Rewrite each subtraction problem as an equivalent addition problem, and compute.      Subtracting 10 gives the same result as adding , so we can write To add two numbers with opposite signs we subtract their unsigned parts to get . And because 10 is greater than 6, the answer is negative. Thus  Subtracting 3 gives the same result as adding , so we can write To add two numbers with the same sign we add their unsigned parts to get . And because both numbers are negative, the answer is negative. Thus   If you feel confident with adding signed numbers, with a little practice you'll be able to do these subtraction problems in your head. Until then, don't hesitate to write down the calculation.  Rewrite each subtraction problem as an equivalent addition problem, and compute.         Subtracting a Negative Number  What does it mean to subtract a negative number? Consider the problem If we use a number line to help us, we begin by plotting the first number, 2. We should then move five units away, but in which direction? Recall that when we add , we move to the left.  But there are only two directions on the number line, so when we subtract , we must move to the right. We finish the problem as shown below, to obtain an answer of .   Subtracting on the number line looks the same as adding . In both problems we move 5 units to the right, and in both problems the answer is 7.  Subtracting a Negative Number  Subtracting a negative number gives the same result as adding a positive number. For both operations, we move to the right on the number line.  This fact makes sense if we think in terms of money, with negative numbers representing debts. Suppose you have a net worth of $200, after writing a check for $500 to repay a loan from your father. Then your father calls to say “As your graduation present, I've decided to cancel your $500 debt, so keep the money.” You now have $700. Subtracting a debt of $500 has the same effect as adding $500 to your account!  Use number lines to illustrate the sum or difference.      We start at and move 3 units to the right.   We start at and move 3 units to the right.    Both problems have the same answer, .  Use number lines to illustrate the problems below. The answers for each pair should be the same!  and   and       Putting together all our examples so far, we can see that:  Subtracting Signed Numbers  Every subtraction problem can be written as an equivalent addition problem.   Rule for Subtraction  We don't really have a new rule for subtraction. Instead, we change every subtraction problem to an equivalent addition problem, and then follow the Rules for Addition .  Subtraction Rule for Signed Numbers   To subtract a positive number, add the corresponding negative number.  To subtract a negative number, add the corresponding positive number.   So how do we change a subtraction problem into an addition problem? Here is a three-step process to follow if the problem is too complicated for an intuitive approach.  To rewrite a subtraction problem as an equivalent addition problem:   Leave the first number alone.  Change the sign of the second number.  Change the subtraction symbol to an addition symbol.   Rewrite each subtraction problem as an equivalent addition problem, then compute.      Subtracting positive 3 is the same as adding negative 3, and we rewrite the difference as a sum as follows.   Now we can use the Rules for Addition. To add two numbers with the same sign we add their unsigned parts to get . And because both numbers are negative, the answer is negative. Thus  Subtracting -12 is the same as adding 12, so   Now we use the Rules for Addition: Because and have opposite signs, we subtract their unsigned parts to get . And because 12 is larger than 8, the answer is positive. Thus,   Rewrite each subtraction problem as an equivalent addition problem, then compute.        Net Change  We compute the net change in a quantity by subtracting its initial value from its final value. Notice that if the final value is smaller than the initial value, the net change is negative.   The bar graph shows the prime time Nielsen ratings for the major networks for the week ending February 3, 2001, compared to their previous totals.    What was the net change in ABC's rating?  Complete the table showing the net change in ratings for each of the networks.    Network  NBC  Fox  ABC  CBS  WB  UPN   Change in Rating          If we know the starting value and the net change in a variable, we can calculate its final value. The bar graph shows the change in annual sales for Solaria.com over six years.    In 2008, Solaria posted 4 million dollars in sales. What was its sales total in 2009?  Complete the table showing Solaria's sales totals for the next five years.    Year  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014   Sales (million $)        In which year did Solaria post its lowest sales total?  In which year did Solaria post its highest sales total?     Notation  We have now used the symbol \" \" in two different ways: to indicate subtraction and to denote a negative number. We will have to be careful not to confuse these two different meanings. So far, we have been careful to include the sign of a number inside parentheses, to distinguish it from the operation symbol for adding or subtracting. But you won't always be provided with these helpful hints. Consider the expression  We can read this expression as \"negative 8 subtract 13.\" Or, changing to an equivalent addition problem, we get  You can check that both these expressions yield the same result, . After all, we perform subtraction by changing to an equivalent addition problem. So why not interpret as a sum in the first place?  That is what we'll do. When we see a string of numbers separated by plus or minus signs, we'll treat it as a sum of signed numbers. For example, the expression means \"add and and and ,\" to get .  Simplify the sum of signed numbers  Working from left to right, first we add and to get , then we add to the , to get .  Simplify each expression as a sum of signed numbers.        Profit and Loss  Here is a formula for calculating profit. Revenue is the amount of money a company takes in from selling its product. They have to subtract their operating costs from their revenue to calculate their profit. If a company's costs exceed its revenues, their profit will be negative, which means that the company will experience a loss.  The bar graph shows GoSolar's costs and revenues for the years 2011-2015.    Fill in the table with the values of revenue and cost from the bar graph.    Year  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015   Revenue        Cost        Profit        Compute the company's profit for in each year and complete the table.

Vocabulary   sum  difference  net change  profit  revenue  cost     Practice 7-2  For Problems 1-8,  Rewrite the subtraction problem as an equivalent addition problem.  Illustrate the problem on a number line.                    Explain why subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number. They move in the same direction on the number line.  Explain why we don't need any new rules for subtraction of signed numbers.  For Problems 11-24, subtract. Rewrite as an equivalent addition problem if that is helpful.                 Delbert participated in a student math competition at his school. There were three rounds of problem-solving. Delbert earns points for correct answers, but loses points for each incorrect answer. The bar graph shows Delbert's results after three rounds.    Find Delbert's score on each round.  The final score for each contestant is the sum of the scores on each round. Find Delbert's final score.       The bar graph shows the quarterly revenue and cost figures for Infocom, a new internet service provider.    Compute Infocom's profit for each quarter of the year.

  "body": " Multiplying and Dividing Signed Numbers   Multiplication  Division  Powers of Negative Numbers    Multiplication  Multiplication of integers is really just a short cut for repeated addition. For example, Similarly, Because the sum of five 's added together is , the product is equal to also.  Think of this problem in terms of money: if you owe five different people two dollars each, then you are actually in debt by $10.  It is also true that because we can multiply two numbers in either order and get the same answer.  From these examples, the following rule seems reasonable.  Opposite Signs  The product of two numbers with opposite signs is negative.        Multiply.         What about the product of two negative numbers?  Product of Negative Numbers  The product of two negative numbers is positive.  This rule is the hardest one to understand. Try reading the Note below to see if it convinces you.  Earlier we argued that erasing a debt of $500 had the same effect as adding $500 to your net worth. This example helped us understand that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number.  Now imagine that three debts of $500 are erased from your balance sheet. This is equivalent to increasing your net worth by $1500. We express this mathematically as      Multiply.         We already know that the product of two positive numbers is positive. And here is another reasonable fact:  Products with Zero  Zero times any number, positive or negative, is zero.  For example,  Combining all these facts, we get the following set of rules.  Products of Signed Numbers   The product of two numbers with the same sign is positive.  The product of two numbers with opposite signs is negative.  The product of any number and zero is zero.    Division  Division is the opposite operation for multiplication. Every division fact can be rewritten as an equivalent multiplication fact. For example, We'll use this idea to investigate division of signed numbers.  Quotients  Each division problem below is rewritten as a multiplication problem.  because  because    In the first multiplication problem, should the blank be replaced by a positive number or a negative number?  Why?  Fill in the blanks:  From this example, we see that:  The quotient of a negative number and a positive number is .  In the second multiplication problem, should the blank be replaced by a positive number or a negative number?  Why?  Fill in the blanks:  From this example, we see that:  The quotient of two negative numbers is .  Compute the quotients.        What about quotients involving zero? We know that zero times any number is zero, so what does that mean for division?  Quotients Involving Zero   We'll first consider two examples where zero is divided by a number. Rewrite each quotient as a product.   What number can we use to replace the question marks and make true statements? There is only one possible answer. and  From these examples, we see that: The quotient of zero divided by any number (except zero) is .  Next we'll look at two examples in which a number is divided by zero. Again, begin by rewriting each quotient as a product.   What number can we use to replace the question marks and make true statements?  Because zero times any number is zero, we cannot find any number that will result in a product of 15 or a product of 4. There is no solution to either multiplication problem, and consequently there are no solutions to the division problems either. We say that division by zero is undefined.  The quotient of any number divided by zero is .  Compute the quotients.        We summarize the rules for division as follows.  Rules for Dividing Signed Numbers   The quotient of two numbers with the same sign is positive.  The quotient of two numbers with opposite signs is negative.  Zero divided by any number (except zero) is zero.  The quotient of any number divided by zero is undefined.    Powers of Negative Numbers  Recall that an exponent indicates repeated multiplication. For example, where 4 is called the base and 3 is called the exponent. We read as \"4 to the third power\" or \"4 cubed.\" We can also compute powers of negative numbers.  Powers of Negative NUmbers  To show that a negative number is raised to a power, we must enclose the negative number in parentheses.  For example, to indicate the square of 5, we write If the negative number is not enclosed in parentheses, then the exponent applies only to the positive number. The negative sign tells us that the power is negative. For example,  Look carefully at how the placement of parentheses changes the meaning of the expressions in the next Example.  Compute each power.        Only 4 is squared:  The negative number is squared:  Only 4 is squared:  Only 4 is squared, and the entire expression appears within parentheses:   Write each power as a repeated product, then compute.            Vocabulary   product  quotient  power  expponent     Practice 7-3  For Problems 1-8, multiply or divide, if possible.                                                                     Use the idea of repeated addition to explain why the product of a positive number and a negative number is negative. Adding several negative numbers gives a negative sum.  Use ideas about money to explain why the product of two negative numbers is positive.  Delbert says that \"two negatives make a positive.\" For which operations is he correct: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Multiplication and division  True or False:  The product of any number and zero is undefined.  The quotient of any number divided by zero is undefined.  The quotient of zero divided by any number is undefined.  The sum of any number and its opposite is undefined.

It is used as a refrigerant in medical research, and it can also be used to remove pollutants and metal ions from waste water. Nitrogen freezes into solid form at a temperature of F.  Suppose your lab is kept at a temperature of F, and your equipment can lower the temperature of nitrogen by F per minute. How long will it take for nitrogen gas to solidify? The answer to this question is the solution of the equation In this section we'll solve equations that involve negative numbers.  Recall that we solve an equation by undoing in reverse order the operations performed on the variable. To solve the equation we first subtract 6 from both sides, then we divide both sides by 2. The solution is . If you like, you can review solving equations in Section 2.5 and Section 5.4 .  A Quick Refresher  Consider the expression We might naturally read this expression as \"8 subtract ,\" but we can also thnk of it as the sum of 8 and .  In fact, we can think of any string of terms as a sum, where the and symbols tell us the sign of the term that follows. For example,  We'll use this idea to solve equations involving negative numbers.  Solve the equation  We start by asking ourselves what operations have been performed on .

(You should check the solution.)  Solve    Operations performed on  Steps for Solution   1.  1.   2.  2.   3.  3.   Step 1:  Step 2:  Check:   The Cartesian Coordinate System  Now that you can work with signed numbers, you can study graphs that use both positive and negative numbers. Recall that a graph shows the relationship between the values of two variables.  We used a number line to keep track of operations on signed numbers. To display the values of two variables we need two number lines. We draw a second number line perpendicular to the first one, as shown below. The values on this second number line increase from bottom to top, and the two lines intersect at the zero points of each.  The horizontal number line is called the -axis , and the vertical number line is the -axis . The point where the two axes intersect is called the origin . The two axes divide the plane into four regions called quadrants , which are numbered 1 through 4 counter-clockwise around the origin.   This system for locating points in the plane was inspired by the French philosopher and mathematician Rene Descartes, who lived in the seventeenth century. It is called a Cartesian coordinate system in his honor.   Plotting Points  Now we can use both positive and negative values when we graph an equation. We'll begin by plotting points on a Cartesian coordinate system. In Section 5.5 we plotted points from a table of values for two variables, and the same method works here.  How to Plot Points   The first variable (the input variable ) tells us the location of the point in the horizontal direction.  The second variable (the output variable ) tells us its location in the vertical direction.   We'll plot each pair of values in the table below as a point on a graph.                    The first pair of values is and , which we write as . We call the numbers 2 and 6 the coordinates of the point; 2 is the -coordinate and 6 is the -coordinate . The coordinates of a point describe its location in the plane.  To plot the point we first find 2 on the -axis (to the right of the origin), and from there move 6 units directly up, as shown at right.  The expression (2, 6) is called an ordered pair , because the order of the numbers is important. The first number in the pair is always the value of the input variable, and the second number is the value of the output variable.  Coordinates  The location of a point in the plane is given by an ordered pair , where is the -coordinate of the point, and is the -coordinate .  The signs of the coordinates tell us which direction to move when plotting the point.  Starting at the origin, we move along the -axis to the right if the -coordinate is positive, and to the left if the -coordinate is negative.  From this location on the -axis, we move up if the -coordinate is positive, and down if the -coordinate is negative.   Plot the points and .  To plot , we move 3 units to the left of the origin, then 4 units up. This point lies in the second quadrant. To plot , we move 5 units to the left, then 1 unit down into the third quadrant. Both points are shown below.   Plot the point   The signs of the coordinates determine in which of the four quadrants the point will appear. If one (or both) of its coordinates is zero, the point lies on one of the two axes.  Plot the points and .  If the -coordinate is 0, the point lies on the -axis, like the point shown at right. If the -coordinate is 0, the point lies on the -axis, like the point .   Plot the following points on the grid.           Graphing Lines   At the start of this section we looked at an equation for freezing nitrogen. If represents the temperature of the nitrogen after it has been cooling for minutes, we have the equation The graph of this equation looks like this. (You can review graphing equations in Section 5.5 .)    Decreasing line of Temperature vs time  Remember that each point on the graph tells us something about the variables involved. For instance, the point tells us that the temperature of the nitrogen started at F.  What does the point tell us?  At the point we have and . After 10 minutes the temperature of the nitrogen is F.  When does the nitrogen reach a temperature of F? At , or at 13 minutes.  The simplest and most useful type of equation relating two variables has a very simple and useful graph. These equations are called linear equations because their graphs are straight lines.  Linear Equations  An equation of the form where and are constants, is a linear equation . Its graph is a straight line.  In Section 5.5 we used three steps to graph an equation.  Steps for Graphing an Equation   Make a table of values. Choose values for the input variable and use the equation to find the values of the output variable.  Choose appropriate scales and label the axes.  Plot the points from the table, and connect them with a smooth curve.   Graph the equation  We begin by making a table of values. We should choose both positive and negative values for the input variable, . Then we calculate the output values by substituting the -values into the equation.     Calculation   Ordered Pair                                                we choose  these values   we calculate  these values    Next, we sketch a Cartesian coordinate system and scale the axes. For this graph, we choose scales from 5 to 5 on the -axis, and from 5 to 15 on the -axis.  Then we plot each of the points in the table and connect them with a smooth curve.  You should find that all of the points lie on a straight line, as shown in the figure.    If we choose more -values and plot more points, we will find that the line extends forever in either direction. To indicate this we draw an arrow head at each end of the line, as shown in the figure.  Graph the equation   Complete the table.                    Label the scales on the axes.  Plot the points from the table and connect them with a straight line.   Graphing Lines  How many points do we need to plot in order to draw an accurate graph? Perhaps you can see that to graph a line we really only need two points (and a ruler or straight-edge). It is a good idea to plot three points, though, as a check.    Graph the equation  Complete the table.              Label the scales on the axes.  Plot the points from the table and connect them with a straight line. Extend your line to the edges of the grid.   If the coefficient of is a fraction, we can simplify the calculations by choosing -values with the fraction in mind.  Graph the equation   Complete the table.              Label the scales on the axes.  Plot the points from the table and connect them with a straight line. Extend your line to the edges of the grid.     Applications of Linear Equations  Linear equations describe many common situations.  Byron borrowed $6000 from his uncle to help pay for his college education. Now that he has graduated and has a job, he is paying back the loan at $100 per month. (His uncle is not charging Byron any interest on the loan.)  Write an equation showing the amount of money, , that Byron still owes his uncle after months.  Graph your equation.  Use your graph to find out how long will it take Byron to pay off his debt.    Byron subtracts $100 from his debt each month, so  We choose values for and make a table showing several points on the graph. Then we plot the points and connect them with a straight line.              Byron has paid off his debt when the amount he still owes his uncle is $0, or when . On the graph, the point with -coordinate 0 has -coordinate 60. Thus, it will take Byron 60 months, or 5 years, to repay his uncle.   Note You can check your answer to part (c) of the previous Example by solving the equation  Chloe's All-Night Diner buys coffee in 50-pound containers. They use 2 pounds of coffee per day.  Write an equation for the number of pounds of coffee, , left days after they open a new container.  Graph your equation on the grid.              Chloe's orders more coffee when they have 8 pounds left in the container. Use your graph to find out how long that will take.
